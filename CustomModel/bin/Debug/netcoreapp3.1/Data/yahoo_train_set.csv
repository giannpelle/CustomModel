Obviously it's not ok for white people to say it, but why can other races?","just taking mexicans as an ex. they r a minority too and go thru a lot of the same things blacks go thru so we kinda identify with them. so they get to slide. and most of the time when a white person uses it its meant to be derogative. but i have had some white friends that were so cool with us that they use it too. the meaning of words changes over time thats what peeps have to understand."
"7","It's my work Christmas Party tonight, do you think I should chat up the sexy girl from reception?","","When faced with a decision like this, go with whichever choice has the least worst outcome.\n\nIn this case, if you chat her up but are refused you may feel embarrassed or hurt but those feelings will go away in time. On the other hand, if you don't turn on your charm, you may miss the opportunity of finding a fantastic partner.\n\nFor me, not taking action and then constantly regretting it is worse than embarrassment.  Go for it and at least you can be proud you gave it your best shot."

"2","what is black ice?","","Black ice\nBlack ice is a thin coating of ice on a surface, often a roadway. While not truly black, it is transparent, allowing the usually-black asphalt/Macadam roadway to be seen through it, hence the term.\n\nIt is usually deposited by freezing rain, mist, or fog. Because it contains relatively little entrained air in the form of bubbles, black ice is transparent and thus very difficult to see (as compared to snow, frozen slush, rime ice, or other typical roadway forms of ice). In addition, it often has a matte appearance rather than the expected gloss; and often is interleaved with wet pavement, which is identical in appearance. For this reason it is especially hazardous when driving or walking.\n\nBlack ice may form even when the ambient temperature is several degrees above the NTP freezing point of water. This occurs typically, and treacherously, when terrain contours and/or prevailing wind cause a local steep differential of atmospheric pressure and/or temperature or when the atmosphere has warmed up after a prolonged cold spell that leaves the temperature of the ground (and roadway!) well below the freezing point.\n\nBlack ice also refers to the slick layer that forms on roadways from a light rain after a period without any precipitation. The water mixes with the road dust and oil but doesn't wash away. This leaves the road surface as slick as ice, slicker than just being wet with water. This type of road hazard can occur any time of year, but especially in mostly dry summer months.\n\nIn either case, while definitely a real phenomenon, ""black ice"" may be cited as the cause of a car crash when, in fact, the real root cause may have been excessive speed, inattention, or some other fault on the part of the driver.\n                    & ALSO\n\nIt is a Top Selling Intrusion Detection!

"10","Someone took pictures of me for a homework assignment and now he's selling them. Is this legal?","It was not evident that he was going to use these to sell. \nHere is a link to the site:\nhttp://www.expressionsofspirit.com/yoga/yoga-art.htm\nI am one of the people in these photos and never gave consent for them to be sold.","As far as I can tell, it is illegal to sell them without your consent.  Under U.S., they can be used for a ""socially useful purpose,"" but I don't see how selling them is useful.  Actually based on this article, you could possibly sue the person who is using your photo, though I doubt that you would get anywhere near the amount this guy got:\n\nA Los Angeles Times article notes that Nestle USA has been ordered to pay US$15.6 million to former model Russell Christoff for using his likeness without permission.\n\nA photo of Christoff appeared on Nestle's Taster's Choice coffee packaging and in advertisements for several years."

"6","How do I perform and ollie on a skateboard?","","1) Push at a comfortable speed, remember the faster you go the better the pop. \n2) Place your front foot near the middle of your board, about two inches under your bolts. Put your back foot on the tail. \n3) Squat, so you can spring yourself up. \n4) Kick your back foot down so you can pop as you jump up, your front foot should rub upward on your griptape. \n5) Make sure you tuck your knees to your chest, picking up your back foot as well to level the board at a good height. REMEMBER you are jumping forward. \n6) Then come down comfortably, both feet on the board. It will look better if both your feet are over the bolts as well as lessen the stress of impact \n7) Finally bend your legs as you touch down to give it that smooth style and roll away stocked\n\n\n\nu have to remember to slide your foot foward,\n\nkeep practicing, i can now ollie almost two feet!"

"7","Are condo investments a good idea?","I found a one bedroom condo in the Seattle area for around $200,000. It is in a great location. This is the cheapest I've seen any one-bedrooms. Do condos appreciate as fast as homes? \n\nWithout any more information, does this sound like an attractive investment opportunity?","If you're considering this an investment, then I would steer you more towards two or more bedroom condos. The one bedroom condos are very sensitive to housing market fluctuations in that they are the first to suffer and very difficult to sell if the overall housing market declines."

"2","How do hydrogen bonds form?","","In chemistry, a hydrogen bond is a type of attractive intermolecular force that exists between two partial electric charges of opposite polarity. Although stronger than most other intermolecular forces, the typical hydrogen bond is much weaker than both the ionic bond and the covalent bond. Within macromolecules such as proteins and nucleic acids, it can exist between two parts of the same molecule, and figures as an important constraint on such molecules' overall shape.\n\nAs the name ""hydrogen bond"" implies, one part of the bond involves a hydrogen atom. The hydrogen must be attached to a strongly electronegative heteroatom, such as oxygen, nitrogen or fluorine, which is called the hydrogen-bond donor. This electronegative element attracts the electron cloud from around the hydrogen nucleus and, by decentralizing the cloud, leaves the atom with a positive partial charge. Because of the small size of hydrogen relative to other atoms and molecules, the resulting charge, though only partial, nevertheless represents a large charge density. A hydrogen bond results when this strong positive charge density attracts a lone pair of electrons on another heteroatom, which becomes the hydrogen-bond acceptor"

"2","What is EEUMA 143?","It may be a standard or a code for construction of shell & tube heat exchangers","it is actually EEMUA 143.  looks like you can buy it for 25 quid.  according to their web site, it is described as below:\n\n143\nRecommendations for Tube End Welding: Tubular Heat Transfer Equipment Part-1 - Ferrous Materials\n\nISBN0 85931 093 0\n£25.00\n\nDate(1985) (formerly OCMA Spec. No. TEW-1)\nThis specification covers recommended procedures for the tube-end welding of tubes ranging from ½ in (15 mm) to 1½ in (40 mm) nominal diameter and from 1.6 mm to 4.1 mm wall thickness to tube plates of 15 mm and over in ferritic and austenitic materials."
"2","how come a chickens lay an egg every day? What will be the biology explanation for it?","I believe that the process of producing and laying an egg is consuming a lot of resources. Why would nature create such a process? It doesn’t seems to be reasonable","Do you REALLY want to know the answer to this question?\n\nThe answer to why chickens lay eggs is in reproduction. Just as women have monthly cycles of discarded eggs, so do chickens. The eggs you eat are the bi-product of the reproduction cycle in the form of an unfertilized egg. That red spot you might see on occasion, that's a fertilized egg and was the beginning of a chick but plucked from the nest before it had a chance to mature. In most commercial hen houses where chickens are housed in small cages, there are no roosters.\n\nI don't think chickens lay eggs every day and that is why you would usually need more than one if you want eggs on a daily basis, but chickens do lay often."
"2","What's the difference between a frost and a freeze?","Like..Frost Warning or Freeze warning.","Freeze is a particularly cold spell of weather, a snow storm or an ice storm.

"9","How young is too young?","Hypothetically speaking, suppose there was someone approximately 44 engaged to a sixteen year old. (both are madly in love w/ eachother.) bad???","She should wait until she's at least 18 to make such a life changing decision.  They really could be in love, I believe that.  But she needs to think of her future before tying herself down at such a young age.  And if he really loves her, he'll give her the freedom to do that."
"5","manage my dsl internet connection sharing.?","I have a DSL connection and i share it with another system. I want to disconnect it without unplugged LAN wire & without unchecked my DSL connection to sharing i.e without change IP address on Server system.","i assume you don't have a DSL router - which would be the best solution.\n\nIf you want the client machine to stay connected to the internet, you have to keep the server machine connected to DSL and keep sharing the connection. Alternatively, you could just plug that client machine into the DSL, but you'd have to set it up to login or whatever and, if you have some sort of DSL modem, you may need to restart it.\n\nOf course, that opens your second machine up to the usual internet dangers of port scanners and such.\n\nLike I said before, the best thing would be to get a DSL router that connects to the DSL where you could connect any machine to the DSL without it being dependent on any other machine, and you can set up the router to open certain ports so that a web server or Quake server can still work."
"2","How can it RAIN when the temperature is 26 degrees F (which is happening right now here in SE Idaho)?","","One of two things.

"1","Taking Darwinism seriously leads consequently to Nazism or some ideology alike ?","","No, no, no. What you are referring to is social Darwinism or eugenics, where people believe in the superiority of one race, and that this superiority justifies cruelty to other groups. Eugenics is largely discredited today. Evolutionary psychology goes to great lengths to distance itself from eugenics. Try the wikipedia page below for more information."
"7","I believe in God, but have no religion. Please tell me which one is the best?","","If you consider yourself a ""Christian,"" believing in the judeo-christian-muslem ""God"" I'd find myself a nice non-denominational church to attend. Or possibly a Society of Friends (Quaker) church to attend.\n\nHowever, if you are looking for an opportunity to search beyond the Christian attitude of ""the Bible has all the answers, look no farther"" I would take a look at one of the Eastern spiritual practices like hunduism, buddhism or taoism.\n\nIf you don't know much about these eastern philosophies, take a look at the link below. This site can teach you the basics of each religion -- and many other of the predominant religions. You may find what you are looking for."

Scholarships are reserved for students with very high GPA's, huge social work resumes, and citizens. My company has been giving out scholarships for a few years and we just have not seen the level of knowledge, drive, and social work needed to justify a scholarship to a non-us citizen yet. This could change, however, there are thousands if not hundreds of thousands of foreign students who wish to study in the US."
"2","difference between  ice and snow?","What is the difference between ice and snow?  When and at what temperature does the transformation take place?","Both ice and snow are frozen water.  Snow flakes are crystalized.  If you catch a ""fresh"" snowflake in the air with a glove, you can see that it really looks like the pictures of snowflakes - hexagonal, and symmetric.\n\nFor snow to change into ice, it has to melt first (getting rid of that crystalization), and then refreeze."

Either it goes on forever or it comes to and end and that's it, nothing more. Concepts of infinity and nothing are difficult to wrap your mind around and this is why it's so hard to understand by meer human beings, an organism just barely come out from the tree swingers we once were not so long ago.

"10","Why is having females in the military a good thing?","","the question is too simple... there are pros and cons.  i think it is great to afford women in this country as many of the same opportunities to serve as we can.  but i do think there are some differences that we as a society must be ready to accept if they are going to be on the front lines.  it was hard for americans to see the desecrated bodies of american soldiers in mogadishu-dragged by the locals-how hard will that image be when its a woman? i will agree that women can be as aggressive and intelligent as men when called on to fight. i have seen a lot of impressive things from women troopers-ladies who can keep up with me on a march, and i'm not slow. who can shoot as well as me- and i shhot excellently. but combat involves a lot of ""hurryup and wait"" and boredom sets in...if i was in a foxhole with a female for days waiting for an attack that might never come, what happens when things get sexually heavy? will we be punished? yep. is it a natural instinct to find comfort with the opposite sex? yep. does it screwup the good order and discipline? yep. read robert heilein's starship troopers- or watch the crappy movie- you'll see that american society presently has a lot of gender hangups that make this a flawed effort.  we have some successes, but we have a long way to go.  presently they require seperate showers, berthing, and toilet facilities...which means some navy ships have to be expensively refurbished and welded to provide those spaces... also, it can be a distraction- it just is... as a soldier you train hard to mostly shut off that sexual need, and concentrate on the misery of your life while deployed- the scent of a woman is terribly distracting at those times and requires an even higher effort of selfdiscipline.  if you think the rules for sexual harassment are tough on cvillians-you have no idea what it is here.  also, consider the following tactical scenario... a flight crew gets shot down behind enemy lines and there are only 2 survivors- a male intelligence officer who has tactically important knowledge, and a female grunt who is a lower level iportance to the overall mission.  they hae been trapped in a POW camp for 8 months, and after being raped by her captor she is now pregnant. however, the rescue gets botched and there is only enough room to evacuate one of the prisoners-the intel officer is of tactical advantage, but he (in my opinion) must be left to save the innocent infant-further damaging the mission. i know its a stretch of the iagination, but i think it- and the public's horror and dismay at the jessica lynch episode, demonstrates that in our society's eyes a women captive is of more value than a man, and that gives me pause. and don't tell me about women aren't on the front lines- that's dated WW2 war theory- the front lines in a guerrilla war/ terrorism fight are constantly moving so that nowhere is safe..."

"3","Why do some women skip a period even though they aren't pregnant?","I took a pregnancy test and it was negative, but i still haven't started my period.  It isn't unusual for me to skip a period, but this is the first time i have skipped one while being sexually active.  I am not scared to be pregnant, i would actually like to be, but i just don't understand.","There are many reasons why a period could be missed including diet, stress, pregnancy, infection, and hormonal balance.  As pregnancy blood tests are the most accurate, it is best to have one done 2 weeks after a missed period.  If it turns out to be negative, then your doctor can do further testing to see what's going on."

"2","how much money do neurologists make?","considering it as a career...just curious to know how much they actually make on average.","It all depends on their subspecialty. A neurologist who does EMG's or sleep studies makes more than someone who does cognitive or behavioural neurology, for instance. As a rule the more procedures one does, the more money one makes. It also varies quite a bit by location but just to give you an idea, a neurologist in a busy private practice can probably make 200-300 K per annum. In academic practice they make about 100 K less than that. These figures are for initial salaries."

I love to dabble with anything that catches my interest and always strive to try something new to expand my knowledge and understanding (and, of course, trying to have as much fun as possible along the way). \n\nMy background is fairly varied and straddles both development and design: I did two years of Computer Sciences (at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich), but found it far too academic and uninspiring. After working as an assistant for a professional photographer for a few months, I upped sticks, moved to the UK, and switched to a Graphic Design course, followed by a Masters in Creative Technology. \n\nIf I had to choose one of the areas that I'm most comfortable working in, I'd have to settle for photography. I've been shooting since I was about 16 years old, and I have, in the last few years, also started collecting older cameras (I've nearly completed my collection of all of Canon's A and F series). Despite my other interests in digital technology, I still prefer to use real film - mostly black and white. There is a certain quality to the analogue medium (such as black and white film's response to light, and the very natural looking grain you get at 400 ASA and above) and the 'craft' involved in manual shooting and working around film's limitations that I'm passionate about."

"1","why is santa claus called kris kringle and father christmas ?","","Dr. Clausenstein invented the first prototype Santa in 1798 out of used human parts that he assembled in a secret laboratory in the alps. While the original Kris Kringle was a disaster, killing eight deer and seriously harming four small children, the very next attempt was a complete success, never harming another soul or animal. Although inconceivable today, Dr. Clausenstein was never granted a patent for his creation and was subsequently hanged for abominable crimes against humanity, forcing the monster Satan Claus (as he was known after the trial) to flee to the north pole."

"2","How does a laser work?","","skyman,\n\nthis is kind of a big question since there are very very many different kinds of lasers that work very differently.  i'll try to answer it in a general way.\n\nLASER stands for Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation.  i'll get to exactly what that means in a minute.\n\nthe earliest laser was a rod of ruby crystal, with mirrors on both ends with the shiny faces pointing towards the crystal, and some very bright flashbulbs around the sides.  one of the mirrors was a perfect mirror - 100% of the light was reflected - and the other was not quite - 99% or so was reflected but about 1% passed through.\n\nthe way it worked was that you'd fire the flashbulbs, which would shine very brightly into the ruby crystal.  all the atoms in the ruby absorb some energy from the light and their electrons go to a higher-energy state - this is called a ""population inversion"" and is important to the operation of a laser.\n\nanyway, before long some of those atoms will start emitting photons and settling back down into their ground state.  some photons will be going the right direction so that they bounce back and forth between the mirrored ends of the rod, over and over.  \n\nevery time a photon goes past an excited atom, it causes the atom to radiate a photon too, in the same direction and in phase with the original photon.  this is the ""stimulated emission"" in LASER.  before long this cascades into a torrent of photons, all bouncing back and forth between the mirrors - about 1% of them leak out and you get a laser beam.\n\nthere are a lot of other designs for lasers, but they all work on the same fundamental principle.  you have some kind of material that can emit photons when it's in an excited state, and you put it between two mirrors in what is called an optical resonator or optical cavity.  of course there are a lot more technical details that i'm skipping over, but hopefully you get the basic idea."

It can also be defined as an inclined plane wrapped around a shaft.\n\nA screw used as a threaded fastener consists of a shaft, which may be cylindrical or conical, and a head. The shaft has a helical ridge or thread formed on it. The thread is essentially an inclined plane wrapped around a shaft. The thread mates with a complementary helix in the material. The material may be manufactured with the mating helix (tapped), or the screw may create it when first driven in (a self-tapping screw). The head is specially shaped to allow a screwdriver or wrench to grip the screw when driving it in. It also stops the screw from passing right through the material being fastened and provides compression."

"1","Is there proof that homosexuality is not a sin?","","Simple answer: The ""sinful"" condition of homosexuality can not be proven or disproven, one way or another.\n\nComplex Answer: Sin is a concept presented by religion, which is based in faith, not science. By using the word ""proof"" you are asking for scientific evidence to support a faith based concept, which is not only impossible, but unnecessary. If you have faith, you need no proof.\n\nHomosexuality as a sin (or not a sin) is something that can no more be proven than the ""fact"" that Jesus rose from the dead on the third day. This is not to say that this didn't happen, but what we need to understand is that this is something that we take on as faith.\n\nHebrews 11:1 Now faith is the substance of things hoped for, the evidence of things not seen.\n\nHomosexuality is labeled a sin in Leviticus 13 (somewhere), and only by this account does the Christian world understand it to be a sin. However, none of this can be tested and proven through scientific testing."

First, the argument that we are there for oil.  If this were the case, you would have seen American oil companies moving in, special trade agreements, and lower oil and gas prices.  This has not happened, so I doubt this is the case.  Second, that Bush was lying.  Bush didn't lie about the wmd's because he didn't make up the intelligence.  He believed the information given to him by people who also believed in it, and just because it was incorrect does not mean he lied.  \nHowever, I believe wholeheartedly that we should still be there, and continue to be there until things have stabilized.  We made a promise to those people, and we must keep it.  I guarantee you, if this works out, thirty years down the road when this is in the history books, we will be the good guys.  In fact, the majority of the Iraqi people love what we are doing.

I heard if their records end up the same, then the first tie-breaker is easiest schedule. In this case Houston would get the 1st pick since Houston has an easier schedule. Or is it the head-to-head matchup that determines the tie-break? So if Houston beats the 49ers in the regular season finale, and both teams end up with the same record, the 49ers would get the first pick. So which is it? Or is there another tie-breaker scenario that takes precedence?","• Strength of schedule for the previous season is the first tie-breaker for teams with the same winning percentage."

"5","Why is power cycling my computer bad?","","There are reasons, and mainly they have to do with power supply kicking off, pulling a lot of current and then your hard drive spin up. They are using air as bearings for the drive, so they float when running but when off sit metal on metal. \n\nIt is like starting a car, a lot of things are happening and typically that is when a car fails. \n\nAlso, if you mean just rebooting all the time, that is because windows creates virtual memory allocations of your hard drive for swap memory. These tend to get fragmented and take up a lot of memory if you just power off without shutting down. If you have done a lot of these, just fragment your hard drive and that will clean up the fragmentation, just not the files themselves."

I recently moved to the east coast of US and I have been traveling in and around Europe for the past couple of years. Of all the things that I have heard about U.S., nothing prepared me for the seclusion that I am being put through, and, I reckon, my being an Indian (not American Indian) has got a lot to do with this discrimination. I am not making a gross-generalization. I do have some American friends (those I got to meet while I was traveling in Europe). But, I guess it is not the best of the places for a third world citizen like I am. It has been over 4 months since I had been to this country and I might have to stay here for couple of years.

I'd appreciate your comments.","wow,\nThis world still is prejudice, although people say we've broken the barriers.

It uses technology anticipating the future 802.11n standard, including multiple input/multiple output (MIMO). Easy setup, a lifetime guarantee, 24/7 toll-free support, WPA security, backward compatibility and built-in parental controls make it the best-reviewed router we found.

Is there any medical or logical reason for this. Sources would be appreaciated.","People naturally sleep better in a cold room or when the body becomes suddenly cold. This is due to part of your circadian rhythm. In addition to sleep naturally being effected by light (your internal clock, the superchiasmatic nucleus, is located near the optic chiasm where the optic nerves cross); most humans will wake easier by the light of the sun and sleep easier in the dark, there is also sleep regulation based on body temperature. \n\nThe human core body temperature changes slightly throughout a day. At around 3 AM the body temperature is at its lowest. It starts to rise until near noon when it plateus and even dips a little bit (this results in people getting tired around lunch time...not because of the lunch itself, after all, you don't get tired after eating breakfast or dinner). Many populations, such as Mexico, take into account this normal fatigue and allow workers to nap (siesta) around that time. Afternoon the body starts rising in temperature again until around 8 PM when it begins to fall again overnight."

Forget about what your friend wants do whats best for YOU. \n\nYou probably don't want to hear this but honesty is the best policy. I don't think your friend is much of a friend if you have to worry about her plotting against you. Think about what you're saying hon,\n\n ""I think that one of her friends might like him as well. . .(not sure if she does though. . .but she might be defending for her other friend"" \n\nYou're telling me that your friend is willing to sacrifice your happiness for someone else's, Is that really a friend?

Luna you know why you said ""I wish she was happy for me because this is the first guy that i could see myself with""? Because a friend is SUPOSED to be happy for you when you find something that makes you happy.

These harsh Earth environments do contain a variety of simple life forms, such as hot vents on the ocean floors, antarctica, etc.  This makes planetary scientists think that it is likely that simple organisms will be found elsewhere in the solar system soon.\n\nThe short answer: Almost, but not quite yet!"
"8","Anime Characters?","Why do some people think that the characters in anime and manga books are hot? Jeeze people, they're drawings. Same for avatars on some web sites. They're fake. How can they be ""hot"" or ""sexy""?","Some people think characters in anime/manga are hot because they are ideal. Meaning that if we, as human beings, could have the guy/girl of our dreams they would be like the characters from our favorite anime/manga. Unfortunatly this isn't good because if we only look to our dream guy/girl we will miss out on meeting a great guy/girl in real life. I personally crush on anime/manga characters but I don't let that close my eyes to the real life guy/girls around me. I use thoses crushes to write fanfics."

"3","wht is a sex?","","Sex has a number of common meanings:\nSexual activities. \nSexual intercourse - or vaginal intercourse; the physical act related to sexual reproduction. \nA general topic of human or animal behavior. See human sexuality. \nSpecies gender - a biological distinction between two or more categories (sexes), such as male and female, which combine genetic material to reproduce. Some linguists object to this use of the word gender, to avoid confusion with the word's meaning in grammar. \nOther things named Sex or SEX include:\n\nSex is a 1926 play by Mae West. \nSex is a 1991 book by entertainer Madonna and photographer Steven Meisel. \nSex: The Annabel Chong Story is a 1999 documentary film about porn star Annabel Chong. \nSEX was a boutique on Kings Road in the Chelsea district of London. Owned by Malcolm McLaren, it was a seminal location in the emerging punk rock scene in the mid-1970s. \nThe ""SEX"" assembly language mnemonic is often used for the ""Sign EXtend"" machine instruction found in the PDP-11 and many other computer architectures. \nSEX is also a good mnemonic for advice about writing essays. It stands for Sentence, Explanation, and eXample. \nSex is an abbreviation for the constellation Sextans.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex_%28disa...\n\nSex, in the scope of this article and category, refers to the male and female duality of biology and reproduction. The somewhat similar term gender has more to do with identity than biology. The concept is confined to organisms that reproduce sexually.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/sex..."
"7","Do police officers in California have the right to take your pulse without your permission?","","Bet I know what happened to you.\n\nIf what you want to know is if police officers have the right to gather evidence, yes...they do.  An abnormal pulse (high or low) can be evidence of drug or alcohol use (more likely drug) and as such, the police are allowed to obtain that information.\n\nYou don't have the right to remain silent and not have your pulse taken because your speech isn't the issue...it's the physical state of your body that's being ""questioned"" and your body does not have the right to remain silent, only your mouth.\n\nVery educated and reasonable people are likely to disagree with me on this.  Doesn't make them right or wrong, just makes them defense lawyers most likely.\n\nThere is no specific statute that says you must submit to a pulse measurement (like there is for DUI, where there's a specific statute that requires you to submit to a chemical test).  However, the police do have a right to gather evidence.\n\nI'm sorry that you were left having to ask this question.  Sounds like it was not explained to you very well (did you ask?).\n\nYou're welcome to write me at my user name at yahoo.com if you have more questions about this (and really, it's not like I'm going to try and find out who/where you are...worst case, somebody got arrested for being high and that's a dime a dozen...I would be more interested in you getting the answers you're looking for and maybe some information about where to find out more)."

Maybe for one whole year if that battery goes bad, they will replace it free. After the year, if the battery goes bad you will not get a free replacement but will get maybe 75% of the price of your battery. The longer you have the battery the less the replacement sum will be. It is prorated according to how long you have had the use of the battery versus how much more use you are guaranteed. A five year battery that goes bad in the first year will be prorated to give you a free battery or a pretty big portion of the cost of that battery. A five year battery that fails in the fourth year will be prorated according to the fact that this is a four year old battery with one more year of warranty. You might just get 25% of the value of a new battery."

"3","Is it possible to get genital warts from other sources other than a parter during sex?","I recently discovered some lumps er.. down below that I'm taking, from what they look like, to be warts, but I was wondering if its possible to get these from anywhere else...","If I understand your question correctly, you are asking if you can get HPV in any way BESIDES having sex/sexual contact with another person.  The quick answer is no.  The HPV virus typically only lives in genital areas (altough there are rare cases where it is present in other mucosal tissue such as the mouth, but that's extremely rare).  The virus could theoretically survive for a small amount of time on an inanimate object (such as a toilet seat) but again, in order to get HPV this way would have to require some pretty controlled situations.  For example, someone with HPV would probably have to consciously rub their gential warts against the toilet seat, afterwhich you would need to contact that same area with your own genitalia almost immediately.  What are the chances of that?\n\nI also wanted to address mutual m*sterbation. You CAN get HPV from mutual mast. HPV warts can be microscopic, invisible to the naked eye. If you touch your partner's genitals and then touch your own with the same hand, you have most likely just put the HPV virus on your own skin. Whether or not you will develop warts/lesions is unpredictable. Some people have HPV but never show any lesions."

"7","Who started the concept of INSURANCE?","","Early methods of transferring or distributing risk were practiced by Babylonian traders as long ago as the 2nd millennium BCE. The Babylonians developed a system which was recorded in the famous Code of Hammurabi, c. 1750 BC and practiced by early Mediterranean sailing merchants. If a merchant received a loan to fund his shipment, he would pay the lender an additional sum in exchange for the lender's guarantee to cancel the loan should the shipment be stolen.\n\nA thousand years later, the inhabitants of Rhodes invented the concept of the 'general average'. Merchants whose goods were being shipped together would pay proportionally divided premium which would be used to reimburse any merchant whose goods were jettisoned during storm or sinkage.\n\nThe Greeks and Romans introduced the origins of health and life insurance c. 600 AD when they organized guilds called ""benevolent societies"" which acted to care for the families and funeral expenses of members upon death. Guilds in the Middle Ages served a similar purpose. The Talmud deals with several aspects of insuring goods.\n\nInsurance became far more sophisticated in post-Renaissance Europe, and specialized varieties developed.\n\nToward the end of the seventeenth century, the growing importance of London as a centre for trade led to rising demand for marine insurance. In the late 1680s, Mr Edward Lloyd opened a coffee house which became a popular haunt of ship owners, merchants and ships’ captains, and thereby a reliable source of the latest shipping news. It became the meeting place for parties wishing to insure cargoes and ships, and those willing to underwrite such ventures. Today, Lloyds of London remains the leading market for marine and other specialist types of insurance, but it works rather differently to the more familiar kinds of insurance. (See Lloyd's of London).\n\nInsurance as we know it today can be traced to the Great Fire of London, which in 1666 devoured 13,200 houses. In the aftermath of this disaster Nicholas Barbon opened an office to insure buildings. In 1680 he established England's first fire insurance company, ""The Fire Office"", to insure brick and frame homes.\n\nThe first insurance company in the United States provided fire insurance and was formed in Charles Town (modern-day Charleston), South Carolina, in 1732.\n\nBenjamin Franklin helped to popularize and make standard the practice of insurance, particularly against fire in the form of perpetual insurance. In 1752, he founded the Philadelphia Contributionship for the Insurance of Houses from Loss by Fire. Franklin's company was the first to make contributions toward fire prevention. Not only did his company warn against certain fire hazards, it refused to insure certain buildings where the risk of fire was too great, such as all wooden houses.\n\nIn the United States, regulation of the insurance industry is highly Balkanized, with primary responsibility assumed by individual State insurance departments. Whereas insurance markets have become centralized nationally and internationally, State insurance commissioners operate individually, though at times in concert through a national insurance commissioner's organization. In recent years, some have called for a federal regulatory system for insurance similar to that of the banking industry.\n\nIn the State of New York, which has unique laws in keeping with its stature as a global business center, attorney general Eliot Spitzer has been in a unique position to grapple with major national insurance brokerages. Spitzer alleged that Marsh & McLennan steered business to insurance carriers based on the amount of contingent commissions that could be extracted from carriers, rather than basing decisions on whether carriers had the best deals for clients. Several of the largest commercial insurance brokerages have since stopped accepting contingent commissions and have adopted new business models."

"3","How do you get rid of muscle soreness after an intense workout?","","Don't stretch before your workout, stretch after, when your body has had a chance to warm-up.  After the workout, make sure you stretch then you can also take an epsom salt bath or use the pool and hot tub for 15 minutes of relaxation to reduce muscle tension.\n\nHere is some help on how to avoid them:\nMinimizing Sore Muscles\nYou can reduce the incidence of pain and sore muscles by following the following tips.\n\nAdopt good training habits.\nAvoid being a weekend warrior. A weekend warrior does little exercise during the week. The words ""couch potato"" come to mind. Then, with a burst of enthusiasm, the weekend warrior ""seizes the weekend"", running, playing, dancing, etc. A better strategy is to exercise regularly. Get into motion 2 or 3 times a week for 20 min at a stretch! \n\nStart with a slow warm up.\nCold muscles suddenly put to work are more likely to become damaged than ones that have been warmed up properly. Warming up gradually will increase your heart and breathing rates, increasing the flow of oxygen and nutrients to your muscles before you begin to work them hard. In addition, your joints secrete more synovial fluid and become less stiff. With a warm-up, the body is properly adapted to the demands of exercise.\n\nBe sure to drink lots of water.\n\nAnd remember to eat a high carbohydrate, low fat diet so your muscles have plenty of fuel.\n\nDo not increase both intensity and duration during the same week.\n\nIf you are on a  strength and endurance program keep your intensity or duration increase to 10% or less each week.  Allow your body to recover properly and adapt slowly to improved performance levels.\n\nSplit Workouts\nIt may seem that doing full body workouts will benefit you the most but you can actually push yourself harder and work your muscles more effectively (avoid muscle soreness) if you work different body parts each day. Modify your strength training routine by, working back, chest, biceps, triceps, shoulders one day and quads, hamstrings, calves, abs the next day. The advantage is that you can easily incorporate supersets, combination sets, and tri-sets into your workout. The disadvantage is that the full upper body workout can get really lengthy.\n\nGet a massage\nEven though research hasn't proved this to speed healing, massage has been shown to lower levels of muscle soreness by stimulating neutrophils (white blood cells that fight inflammation). It goes without saying that athletes feel better after a massage.\n\nDiet Tip\nMaintain a regular intake of 1000 mg of vitamin C and 100-200 mg of bromelain, an enzyme from pineapples, for two days - these are natural anti-inflammatories.\n\nGood blood flow through your muscles is the key to quick, natural healing."

"2","Why does a mirror reverse left and right and not up and down?","","Specular reflection returns the image unaltered, what the mirror is really doing is reversing front and back.  Imagine you are behind some object reflected in a mirror, the farthest point from you is the objects front, this same front is the closest point to you in the reflection.  Now if you think about it we define top and bottom in terms of a fundamental physical law, gravity, right and left on the other hand are not determined this way.  We assign them based on perspective, so when you reverse something in the direction of depth you have to reverse something in the horizontal direction as well."

"10","On separation of church and state.?","Many people have said that separation of chuch and state is part of the Constitution. Where exactly does it say that? I'd like to know why this is refered to over and over again. Additionally, does anyone believe that this has been repeatedly misinterprited from its original meaning?","In the United States, separation of church and state is governed by the Establishment Clause of the First Amendment to the U.S. Constitution and by legal precedents, some quite controversial, interpreting that clause. Although the Establishment Clause states that, ""Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion,"" the U.S. Supreme Court has long interpreted the Fourteenth Amendment (one of the Reconstruction Amendments) as making the Establishment Clause and other portions of the Bill of Rights binding on state and local governments as well. Many other democratic governments around the world have similar clauses in their respective constitutions.\n\nThe phrase ""separation of church and state"" does not appear in the Constitution, but rather derives from a letter written by Thomas Jefferson to a group identifying themselves as the Danbury Baptists. In that letter, Jefferson referred to a “wall of separation between church and state.” James Madison, the father of the U.S. Constitution and the Bill of Rights, wrote in the early 1800s, “Strongly guarded . . . is the separation between religion and government in the Constitution of the United States.” Ulysses S. Grant also called for Americans to ""Keep the church and state forever separate."""

He may be a nice man but an age difference of that much means you two probably don't have very much in common. Your friends and his would be too far apart in age too. Those two factors should be taken into consideration. You also said you thought he was was way too old for you. If you go out on a date, he will get the idea that his age doesn't matter and obviously it does, not only to you but your whole family."
"2","Where does the white go when the snow melts?","","The ""white"" is caused because snow has a great many tiny interfaces, called ""phase boundaries,"" where air (a gas phase) meets ice (a solid phase).  Every time light encounters a phase transition, it is defracted.  If you've ever looked at a stick submerged partially, you've seen this--a straight stick will look like it has a bend in it right at the water's surface.  Well, with snow, the tiny ice crystals, and the many small bubbles in ice (water is a bent and polar molecule, so when it freezes, it expands, making small bubbles inside), and the places where individual ice crystals begin and end--all of this scatters light all around.  This makes it so that a big bunch of snow will look white.  If you look at a single snowflake under a microscope, though, you will see that the crystals individally are clear.\n\nWhen it melts, there is only one phase transition, right at the surface.  The light is defracted a bit, but only once--it doesn't scatter light all around like snow does.\n\nBut it can!  If you've ever seen a big fountain, where the water is splashing and tumbling about, it will also look white due to phase transition.  Likewise, if you make a whole bunch of tiny bubbles under water, you can scatter light and make it look white."

"4","What schooling or education does one need to become a radio D.J.?","I am going to call a few radio stations, but if you could give me an answer, it would really help.","Good question -- it really depends on WHAT you want to do in radio.  The ""act"" of being a DJ -- playing music and turning-on the microphone etc., -- is really very simple.  The hard part is making what you say entertaining and engaging.  Many colleges have broadcasting departments, and offer students a chance to work in college radio to hone their skills.  If you want to go into radio news, you will need a good education in the way government and society works.  Even a two-year AA degree would be a good start.  Record yourself speaking.  Ask your friends to listen.  Are you saying the ends of words?  Do you say ""pencil"" or ""pensa?""  Do you say ""style"" or ""sty?""  Take speech class at the local college (or high school if you're still there) and ask the teacher to REALLY help you.  You will probably develop a ""radio voice"" different from your everyday voice, and over the years, the two will merge.  Visit a few radio stations, and ask if you can just ""hang-out.""  (Not tour, but actually stay for a few hours.)  Before long, a DJ will say ""hey, can you push that button for me?""  Let's face it -- many DJs have big egos, and would love to show you everything they know!  Let them, and take notes."
"1","Why do women get annoyed when I ask if they can do anything practical - like cook, clean, and sew?","","I don't know how you come across in person, but on-line you sound like a jerk who'll kidnap me and make me do this stuff without any reward.\n\nI belive you're just desparate to find you dream though so I'll share ways to get this information without looking like a serial killing jerk:\n\n1.  Don't point blank ask, ""Can you cook clean and sew."" Instead, re-phrase this as:  ""It's been so long since I've had a good home cooked meal.""  If she's good at cooking, she'll want to show off for you, and she'll offer to cook you that meal.  If you get her to cook that meal for you, then acidently <wink-wink> pop a button from your shirt.  If she's good and caring, again, she'll lovingly offer to help you repair it.\n\n2.  Don't demand this.  Remember, not all woman have these talents.  In fact, with the high divorse rates, many woman were raised by men, or working mom's.  Many of us feel inadequite because we don't have these skills < like how a man feels without an income or how he feels if he has small male genetiles >...it's a hurtful subject to certain people, so be respectful <thx>.  Plus, our educational system does not provide training for this anymore.  Be kind and respectful to the woman who arn't skilled in this.  Maybe you'll get a lawyer/accountant/CEO FRIEND who'll help in in the future.  I belive you can never have enough friends.\n\nGood luck and best wishes."

Thank you!","A Homestead Exemption is a discount you have to apply for to have the property tax due reduced. Tax collected is based on the value of your property as well as the tax rate. You can only apply for a homestead exemption if it is your primary dwelling.\n\nThe amount will change every year because the value of your home will generally go up. \n\nProperty Tax is how the city, county, and state collect revenue."

"1","why is it that christians some times act prefect than other making it difficult sinners  come to GOD?","","Alot of Christians (not all) feel there as to be a show.  They are christian so therefore they feel there is a certain way to act and be.  whether it be in just public or in private life as well.  It is difficult to go to church and try to get right with god.  They see your faults and you feel as though they are looking down on you.  There are quite a few of them out there.  However I know that there are plenty who are not.  from my experience there is a face they where.  to show sinners the way to be. (though it doesnt actually work this way) my advice is to try to find a church or a christian group which you feel comfortable with and try to grow and learn with them,  as i said they arent all like that some times you just need to sift through the mess to find them."

Basically this program shows you what's on the server before you download it to your email client and has a built in 'blacklist' of known spammers and such but you can choose to block/blacklist or bounce messages or do all three. By bouncing messages and adding them to the blacklist, you do 2 things, you tell mail washer to mark that message as spam if it comes in again and if you bounce it, chances are that you will be automatically removed from the list that is sending the messages.  One click and the unwanted spam is deleted and you dont have to download it at all to your computer. It really helped clear out my inbox, however, since switching ISPs, I dont have that much of a problem and I also use Thunderbird available at mozilla.org and set up message filters which work well."

"1","Do you believe that God, through Jesus Christ, the Only way to heaven? Not by works or baptism?","Can you please tell me if you're a teen? I just wanted to know how many fellow believers are out there that are around my age! Thanks!","Yes. Water baptism is only a symbolic gesture, even if you believe it to be a very important part in a Christian's life or not, it's ultimately only symbolic. As far as works, these are an expression of Christ's love through a Christian to others, not something that can be done to gain entrance to heaven. The Bible only cites that belief in Jesus is the only requirement for eternal life.\n\nAnd I'm 23, not quite a teenager anymore, but still young enough. :)"
"2","What makes detergent work?","","Detergent is a wetting agent and allows water to wet and dissolve matter that ordinarily resists water such as oil and grease.  Soap is not only a wetting agent but once it surrounds a particle of dirt it forms a film with charged soap molecules aligned such that the entire particle (soap and all) seems like it has a single charge.  Since like charges repel, all particles repel each other and the surface being cleaned and easily rinse away.  Soap and detergent therefore differ in the way they work.  Of course, soap and detergent can be mixed together to do a better job."

The term kangaroo is sometimes used in a broader sense to refer to all members of the macropod family. Kangaroos are native to the continent of Australia, while a number of tree kangaroos are found in New Guinea.\n\nThe word kangaroo is said to derive from the Guugu Yimidhirr (an Australian Aboriginal language) word gangurru, referring to the Grey Kangaroo (see photo to the right). The name was first recorded as kangaru by Joseph Banks on James Cook's first voyage of exploration, when they were beached at the mouth of the Endeavour River in the harbour of modern Cooktown for almost 7 weeks repairing their ship which had been damaged on the Great Barrier Reef."
"10","Would we have more honorable judges and presidents, if the 11th Amenment was Repealed?","Because if it were again easy to sue a state that caused you to be aggrieved, like taking your property without any chance for a hearing.  And by making it easy when the state has clearly done you wrong-illegally-UN-Constitutionally, you see if, like it was supposed to be, that a state would be held liable, this power, would pay off by because more ""Honorable"" persons would be put in positions of power!","I wish things were that easy to conclude without doubt that a court decision is unconstitutional and such has been debated since ratification.  Even so, there is merit to your concerns but not in the process you suggest.\n\nTo begin with, the Eleventh Amendment was proposed, almost unanimously, at the first meeting of Congress after the decision in Chisholm v. Georgia [1793] which held that a State was liable to be sued by a citizen of another State or of a foreign country. \n\nThe Amendment was recognized and upheld by a number of subsequent cases such as Hans v. Louisiana [1890] which opined, “This Amendment, expressing the will of the ultimate sovereignty of the whole country, superior to all legislatures and all courts, actually reverses the decision of the Supreme Court.”  \n\nWhile this was going on, there was also the debate between the Federal Government and the States as to Sovereignty as relative to State Nullification acts.  That is, a single State legislature deciding that a federal act was unconstitutional and not applicable within the borders of that single State.  This continued until 1868 with the application of the fourteenth Amendment [1868] which was upheld in Texas v. White [1869].\n\nThe point is to get the States back into the game balancing against acts of the federal government.  This can be accomplished with a new Amendment recognizing the Sovereignty of the States and their individual ability to nullify federal acts within their borders."

If you've already tried it, then don't bother with this.

Otherwise, just ignore this part and keep going with the next step.\n- Click 'Scheduled Tasks'\n- Now, open the 'Add Scheduled Task' wizard that's at the top of the list.\n- 'Next' button\n- If your app. is on the list, just select it.

Under the 'Settings' tab, make sure to check the box 'Stop the task if it runs for...' and enter your time limit.

"2","Why are greenhouse gasses harmful to the earth?","","Every object (that has a temperature above absolute zero) emits radiation.  What form this radiation takes depends on the temperature of the object - the sun is hot and emits visible light, the earth is cooler and emits heat.  The heat that is emitted from earth would be radiated out into the space if it wasn't for the greenhouse gasses in our atmosphere.  They absorb the heat, and emit it later, so that the heat stays in our atmosphere, where we can benefit from it.\n\nGreenhouse gasses are not harmful to the earth.  Examples of greenhouse gasses are water vapor and carbon dioxide, and they keep up the temperature of earth.  With greenhouse gasses, the average temperature on earth is 15 degrees Celsius above zero (60 degrees Farenheit above zero).  If there were no greenhouse gasses, the average temperature would be 18 degrees Celsius below zero (zero degrees Farenheit).  Quite a difference!\n\nWhen people speak of greenhouse gasses being harmful to the earth, they (most likely) mean that an increase of greenhouse gasses could be harmful, because that would probably mean increasing temperatures, which could lead to a  change in the climate."

That leaves you with 7 1s and 9 2s. It will take you 7 swaps to get the 1s into the correct positions. The worst case will look like: 11112222222221110000\n\nIn general if you have n objects in broken into subsets, it will take you minimum of n - (size of largest subset) exchanges to get them into position by swapping. Swap all the smaller subsets into position first, and the largest subset will end up in the correct position."

"2","why does the clock get set back 1 second every few years once?","","LEAP SECONDS\nCivil time is occasionally adjusted by one second increments to ensure that the difference between a uniform time scale defined by atomic clocks does not differ from the Earth's rotational time by more than 0.9 seconds. Coordinated Universal Time (UTC), an atomic time, is the basis for civil time. \nHistorically, the second was defined in terms of the rotation of the Earth as 1/86,400 of a mean solar day.  In 1956, the International Committee for Weights and Measures, under the authority given it by the Tenth General Conference on Weights and Measures in 1954, defined the second in terms of the period of revolution of the Earth around the Sun for a particular epoch, because by then it had become recognized that the Earth's rotation was not sufficiently uniform as a standard of time.  The Earth's motion was described in Newcomb's Tables of the Sun, which provides a formula for the motion of the Sun at the epoch 1900 based on astronomical observations made during the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries.  The ephemeris second thus defined is \n\nFor more click the source link."

And most in the study who said they were Bi responded more positively to females, although a few seemed to prefer men.\n\nThe same study was performed on heterosexual and gay males and they found that the heterosexuals became more aroused when presented with images of women and gay men tended to react much more strongly to men, as you would expect.\n\nIn my experience women who are bi get a much warmer reception (except among lesbians) and men who are are sometimes shunned by both Gay and Straight people.  \n\nI will try to find an article about the study and post it below."
"2","how far can the signals of a RF transmitter go?","","There are essentially two parameters to look at when trying to determine the range of an RF Transmitter:\n\nTransmit Power\n\n    Transmit power refers to the amount of RF power that comes out of the antenna port of the radio. Transmit power is usually measured in Watts, milliwatts or dBm. (For conversion between watts and dB see below.)\n\nReceiver sensitivity\n\n    Receiver sensitivity refers to the minimum level signal the radio can demodulate. It is convenient to use an example with sound waves; Transmit power is how loud someone is yelling and receive sensitivity would be how soft a voice someone can hear. Transmit power and receive sensitivity together constitute what is know as “link budget”. The link budget is the total amount of signal attenuation you can have between the transmitter and receiver and still have communication occur."

But just believing is not proof or even evidence.\n\nI am not stating what I do or do not believe in this question, just asking your opinion.","The supernatural cannot be proven, that's why it is supernatural.

However, we cannot disprove it either."
"2","Why does rubbing alchohol remove permanent ink from plastic surfaces but whiskey doesn't?","","Water content in whiskey is too high. Even cask strength whiskey rarely exceeds 60%, while rubbing spirit will be 80%-95% alcohol.\n\nAlcohol acts as a lipophile (fat-loving) solvent only when there isn't too much water to emphasize its dipol nature. Permanent markers use lipophile solvents and don't solve in water."
"2","What are the general products in a reaction between a strong acid and an alcohol funtional group?","","Because strong acids are terrible bases (by definition), conjugate base will never deprotonate the alcohol.  However, because there is an electrophile in solution now (hydrogen ions) and lone pairs on the oxygen in the alcohol (nucleophile) the hydroxyl group (alcohol part) can be protonated to make a great leaving group---water.  Now you have a carbocation that will rapidly react with any close nucleophile in solution, or, more likely, it will form a double bond with another carbon and eliminate another hydrogen in the process.  This is most likely at high temperatures (>150C) and with near-concentrated acid.  Otherwise, there will simply be an equilibrium of the protonated alcohol leaving, and then an oxygen coming back.  \n\nThe reaction you are most likely (and most useful) looking for is an acid-catalyzed dehydration (E1) reaction."

The word governement is derived the Greek Κυβερνήτης (kubernites), which means ""steersman"", ""governor"", ""pilot"" or ""rudder""."
"1","How can I get my ""friends"" to back off?","You know how it is when you're a teenager, and some people mature a lot faster than others. So last year I had this group of friends who I rode the bus to school with. We were all pretty close and they all loved me. Then that summer I went on vacation to Florida, and when I came back I realized how immature my friends are compared to me. I started to break away from them until eventually I figured that I really don't want to be friends with these people anymore. The problem is that they all live on my street within a few yards of me, and mostly, they just don't get it. It's like they can't grasp the concept that I'm leaving their little group. All they do is ask me why I don't talk to them and do stuff with them anymore. It's not like I hate these people, I just don't want to be around them. How can I tell them nicely that I just want them to back off?","That can be tricky, especially if you were good friends with any of them.\nThe best thing to do is to just be honest.

"2","Is the set of rational numbers countable or uncountable?","Again please give reasons.","usually the terms ""countable"" and ""uncountable"" refer to a set with an infinite number of members.  in the context of an infinite number of elements, countable means ""you can put them in a well-defined order"".  mathematically this means you can define a one-to-one correspondence between the set's elements and the natural numbers.  \n\nso, the set of real numbers is uncountable, because if you go from 2.0 to 2.1, you have left out 2.05.. and if you instead go from 2.00 to 2.01, you have left out 2.005.. and  so on.\n\nanyway, rational numbers were shown to be countably infinite by georg cantor in 1891.  it was done so using his famous ""diagonal argument"".\n\nto do so, construct a table where you number the columns from left to right with the natural numbers 1, 2, 3, etc, and the rows from top to bottom the same way.  at each table element, write down a fraction where the numerator is the column number, and the denominator is the row number.  because this table has an infinite number of rows and an infinite number of columns, all of the rational numbers will be somewhere on it.\n\nnow, start in the upper left corner, which is 1/1.  take a step to the right (1/2), then down-left along the diagonal until you hit the edge (2/1).  go down (3/1), and then up-right along the diagonal (2/2, and then 1/3).  go right (1/4), and then down-left along the diagonal (2/3, 3/2, 4/1). go down.. and so on.  you keep zig-zagging along the diagonals and by doing so, you can hit every single rational number.  \n\nthe number of steps you have to take to get to a particular rational number defines its index, which means you can count them, which means the set is countably infinite.\n\nif it's hard to picture, you can see a diagram of what i'm talking about at the link below."

This has the effect of making both the summer and the winter more mild than they are more inland, although the effect is not as strong as on the west coast of the US, because the prevailing winds blow from west to east in the US.\n\nAlso, because the ocean currents hitting Boston, MA are coming from the Carribbean Ocean, hurricaines occasionally make their way to MA."

"2","list and describe the conturbution of the scienits who devolped the elements of the peroidc table?","","From Wikipedia.org:\n\n""first devised in 1869 by the Russian chemist Dmitri Mendeleev. Mendeleev intended the table to illustrate recurring (""periodic"") trends in the properties of the elements.""\n\n""The original table was created before the discovery of subatomic particles or the formulation of current quantum mechanical theories of atomic structure. If one orders the elements by atomic mass, and then plots certain other properties against atomic mass, one sees an undulation or periodicity to these properties as a function of atomic mass. The first to recognize these regularities was the German chemist Johann Wolfgang Döbereiner who, in 1829, noticed a number of triads of similar elements:\nSome triads Element Molar mass\n(g/mol) Density\n(g/cm³) Quotient\n(cm³/mol)\nchlorine 35.4527 0.003214 11030\nbromine 79.904 3.122 25.6\niodine 126.90447 4.93 25.7\n \ncalcium 40.078 1.54 26.0\nstrontium 87.62 2.64 33.2\nbarium 137.327 3.594 38.2\n\nThis was followed by the English chemist John Newlands, who noticed in 1865 that the elements of similar type recurred at intervals of eight, which he likened to the octaves of music, though his law of octaves was ridiculed by his contemporaries. Finally, in 1869, the German Julius Lothar Meyer and the Russian chemistry professor Dmitri Ivanovich Mendeleev almost simultaneously developed the first periodic table, arranging the elements by mass. However, Mendeleev plotted a few elements out of strict mass sequence in order to make a better match to the properties of their neighbours in the table, corrected mistakes in the values of several atomic masses, and predicted the existence and properties of a few new elements in the empty cells of his table. Mendeleev was later vindicated by the discovery of the electronic structure of the elements in the late 19th and early 20th century.\n\nIn the 1940s Glenn T. Seaborg identified the transuranic lanthanides and the actinides, which may be placed within the table, or below (as shown above)."""

It takes place on May 3 in celebration of the promulgation of the 1947 Constitution of Japan. It is a part of the collection of holidays known as Golden Week.[1]\n\nA holiday since the current Japanese constitution came into effect on May 3, 1947, this is the only day of the year that the National Diet Building (国会議事堂, kokkai-gijidō) is open to the public.[2] Being a day that draws its significance from the Japanese constitution, Constitution Memorial Day is often chosen as a day to reflect on the meaning of democracy and Japanese government. For instance, in 2003, a number of newspapers featured editorials regarding the constitution's embattled Article 9.[3]"

The Medieval Code of Chivalry was understood by all but a Code of Chivalry was documented in 'The Song of Roland' in the early Medieval period of William the Conqueror. The 'Song of Roland' describes the 8th century Knights and battles of the Emperor Charlemagne and has been described as Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry. The idea of the Code of Chivalry were emphasised by the oaths that were sworn in Knighthood ceremonies. These sacred oaths were combined with the ideals of chivalry and with strict rules of etiquette and conduct. The idea and ideals of a Medieval Code of Chivalry was publicised in the poems, ballads, writings and literary works of Medieval authors. The myths of Arthurian Legends featuring King Arthur, Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table further strengthen the idea of a Medieval Code of Chivalry. The Arthurian legend revolves around the Code of Chivalry followed by the Knights of the Round Table - Honour, Honesty, Valour and Loyalty.\n\nThe Song of Roland - Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry\nA Code of Chivalry was documented in 'The Song of Roland' in the early 11th Century Medieval period of William the Conqueror. The 'Song of Roland' describes the 8th Century Knights and battles of the Emperor Charlemagne and has been described as Charlemagne's Code of Chivalry. The duties of a Knight were described as follows:\n\nTo fear God and maintain His Church\nTo serve the liege lord in valour and faith\nTo protect the weak and defenceless\nTo give succour to widows and orphans\nTo refrain from the wanton giving of offence\nTo live by honour and for glory\nTo despise pecuniary reward\nTo fight for the welfare of all\nTo obey those placed in authority\nTo guard the honour of fellow knights\nTo eschew unfairness, meanness and deceit\nTo keep faith\nAt all times to speak the truth\nTo persevere to the end in any enterprise begun\nTo respect the honour of women\nNever to refuse a challenge from an equal\nNever to turn the back upon a foe.\n\nMedieval Code of Chivalry - the Rules of Courtly Love\nThe following rules of Courtly Love were written by the 12th Century Frenchman, Andreas Capellanus. These 31 rules describe the pure romance of love but also describe love for another man's wife. This 'Courtly Love' is illustrated in the fictional story of Sir Lancelot and Queen Guinevere. But these rules of Courtly Love led to the downfall and execution of Queen Anne Boleyn, the wife of King Henry VIII - who lived his entire life putting in to practise the 'Rules of Courtly Love'.\n\nI. Marriage is no real excuse for not loving.\nII. He who is not jealous cannot love.\nIII. No one can be bound by a double love.\nIV. It is well known that love is always increasing or decreasing.\nV. That which a lover takes against the will of his beloved has no relish.\nVI. Boys do not love until they arrive at the age of maturity.\nVII. When one lover dies, a widowhood of two years is required of the survivor.\nVIII. No one should be deprived of love without the very best of reasons.\nIX. No one can love unless he is impelled by the persuasion of love.\nX. Love is always a stranger in the home of avarice.\nXI. It is not proper to love any woman whom one would be ashamed to seek to marry.\nXII. A true lover does not desire to embrace in love anyone except his beloved.\nXIII. When made public love rarely endures.\nXIV. The easy attainment of love makes it of little value; difficulty of attainment makes it prized.\nXV. Every lover regularly turns pale in the presence of his beloved.\nXVI. When a lover suddenly catches sight of his beloved, his heart palpitates.\nXVII. A new love puts to flight an old one.\nXVIII.

Fusion progresses, turning hydrogen into helium, and eventually heavier elements, until fuel for the fusion is expended. At this point, the star collapses under its own weight, and can result in either a supernova or a black hole, depending on its mass."

"3","what is nuclear medicine?","","Nuclear medicine is a branch of medicine and medical imaging that uses unsealed radioactive substances in diagnosis and therapy. These substances consist of radionuclides, or pharmaceuticals that have been labelled with radionuclides (radiopharmaceuticals). In diagnosis, radioactive substances are administered to patients and the radiation emitted is measured. The majority of these diagnostic tests involve the formation of an image using a gamma camera. Imaging may also be referred to as radionuclide imaging or nuclear scintigraphy. Other diagnostic tests use probes to acquire measurements from parts of the body, or counters for the measurement of samples taken from the patient. In therapy, radionuclides are administered to treat disease or provide palliative pain relief. For example, administration of iodine-131 is often used for the treatment of thyrotoxicosis and thyroid cancer.\n\nNuclear medicine imaging tests differ from most other imaging modalities in that the tests primarily show the physiological function of the system being investigated as opposed to the anatomy. In some centres, the nuclear medicine images can be superimposed on images from modalities such as CT or MRI to highlight which part of the body the radiopharmaceutical is concentrated in. This practice is often referred to as image fusion.\n\nNuclear medicine diagnostic tests are usually provided by a dedicated department within a hospital and may include facilities for the preparation of radiopharmaceuticals. The specific name of a department can vary from hospital to hospital, with the most common names being the nuclear medicine department and the radioisotope department.\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_medicine"

She/he was not on female hormones, and as a result, had no female secondary sexual characteristics (female breasts, softer skin female-pattern body hair, female body-fat distribution).  She/he was a boy who eiether liked dressing like a girl, or possibly couldn't afford hormone replacemant therapy.  And no, being with a transsexual woman doesn't make you gay.  By definition a gay guy is a male who enjoys sexual relations with a male who looks, dresses, and acts like a male.  You may be classified as ""Queer"" in many circles, but you are definately not gay."

"4","does reasoning presumes thinking but thinking does not presume reasoning?","","The lastest research seems to show that reasoning, or solving a problem by logic, does NOT necessarily presume thinking.\n\n>>\nEmotions are postcards from our genes telling us in a direct and nonsymbolic manner about life and death.\n-- Allen Lane\n>>\n\n\nThinking of course can be idle daydreaming, recalling sequences of events etc. No reasoning needed some times.\n\n>>\nIn this world [there] are very few things made \nfrom logic alone. It is illogical for a man to be too logical. Some things we must just let stand. The mystery is more important than any possible explanation . . . The searcher after truth must search with humanity. Ruthless logic is the sign of a limited mind. The truth can only add to the sum of what you know, while a harmless mystery left unexplored often adds to the meaning of life. When a truth is not so important, it is better left as a mystery.\n-- Bryce Courtenay\n>>"

If life were predictable, wouldn't we all be so bored. If we knew what was around each corner would we not turn around and go back?

"5","Are the new maqc operating systems less prone to viruses, span and all the juck that I get wilth a pc?  if so?","","Not just less prone, nearly impervious.  Even viruses designed for OSX (not that I know of any) have trouble executing just because of the robustness and security layers in the operating system itself, it might make it run slower but as far as wreaking havoc on a Mac, it's nearly impossible.  Spam has to do with email so there isn't much you can do there, that has nothing to do with the Operating system.  Also, there is little to no adware/spyware on the Mac, again because it is harder to execute on OSX and because the user base is so low for the Mac OSX platform.\n\nAnd your last part...if so, what?"

"4","Why japanese girls are shamed too much and they dont like foreign peoples???","","I don't think japanese girls are shamed. They are just not used to communicating with foreigners as there are not so many foreigners in Japan after all. Most of them don't speak English or foreign languages so they must kinda be freaked out when foreigners try to approach them I guess. If the foreigners understand Japanese language, they should feel easier. \nI'm sure that more and more Japanese (not only girls) are interested in foreign cultures as well as people."
"7","how much does an average human resource manager make. also, is that job hard to find with proper qualification","","I depends on many factors. Your location and industry are 2 primary factors. Also, experience, education level, size of the organization, and number of people you manage play a role. Experience is an important part of this question because you obviously (although, I've seen it happen) won't became a manager right away. \n\nIn Chicago, I would say that a new HR Manager with a BA degree and 3 years experience working in HR previously could earn $35,000 to $50,000 a year. The range is huge because...well...you'll learn that once you get into HR."

"2","Why do planets turn over the sun on ellipse ways?","","The elliptical orbits are the result of Kepler's Law; the shape of a planet's orbit around a larger mass is a function of each planet's mass and the distance between the orbits.  One can derive the elliptical orbit path from Newton's Laws; when you start from Newton's Laws and perform this derivation, your result will be an equation in the form of an ellipse.\n\nSometimes orbits are not elliptical, but are circular.  Consider binary stars - when the masses of 2 binary stars is equal, the respective orbial path traced by each star is a cicrle in the complex plane, not an ellipse.\n\nBy the way, symmetry is one of the most natural phenomena observable.  To say that symmetry is not found in nature very often is an indication of lack of advanced physical and mathematical study.  Consider rings, field, and group theory.  Symmetric wavefunctions of identical particles and allowable energetic transition states in a molecule or, in some cases, an atom.  I could list 1000 different natural PERFECT symmetries based on solid foundations of laws of conservation and irrefutable mathematics, but only because I am limited as a human being in my knowledge of symmetrical processes.  There are many more than 1000 examples.  You get my point."

"2","what is the longest organ in our body?","","Organs - Small intestine \n \n \n \n       \n \n\nSystem: Digestive\n\nLocation: Abdomen\n\nPhysical description: A five metre long narrow tube that hangs in sausage-like coils\n\nFunction: Chemical digestion of food and absorption of nutrients into your blood\nLongest section of your digestive tract\n\nYour small intestine is around five metres long, making it the longest section of your digestive tract. Although it is longer than your large intestine it has a smaller diameter. This is why it's called the small intestine.\n\nChemical digestion\n\nAfter food is churned up in your stomach, a sphincter muscle at the end of your stomach opens to squirt small amounts of food into the top of your small intestine. This first section of the small intestine is called the duodenum.\n\nYour pancreas releases digestive juices through a duct into your duodenum. This fluid is rich in enzymes that break down fats, proteins and carbohydrates. It also contains sodium bicarbonate which neutralises acid produced in your stomach.\n\nYour gall bladder squeezes out bile down a duct into your duodenum. Bile helps break down fats in your food.\n\nPeristalsis\n\nDigesting food is pushed through the small intestine by peristalsis. Peristalsis is a muscular movement in which alternating waves of muscle contraction and relaxation cause food to be squeezed along the digestive tract.\n\nAbsorbing nutrients\n\nMost of the nutrients in the food you eat pass through the lining of your small intestine into your blood. The lining of the small intestine is covered in tiny microvilli. These are microscopic, finger-like protrusions which give the lining of the small intestine a massive surface area for absorption of nutrients to occur across. The microvilli give the inside of the intestine the look and feel of velvet.\n\nEach microvillus contains a minute blood capillary. When nutrients are absorbed into a microvillus, they enter its blood capillary. This is how nutrients from your food enter your blood.\n\nIndigestible food passes into the large intestine\n\nBy the time food leaves your small intestine all the nutrients in your food will have entered your bloodstream. All that remains is indigestible food which is passed from your small intestine to your large intestine for further processing."
"4","what is diabetes miletus?","","Diabetes is a disease in which the body is unable to produce or unable to properly use and store glucose (a form of sugar). Glucose backs up in the bloodstream — causing one’s blood glucose (sometimes referred to as blood sugar) to rise too high. \n\nThere are two major types of diabetes. In type 1 (fomerly called juvenile-onset or insulin-dependent) diabetes, the body completely stops producing any insulin, a hormone that enables the body to use glucose found in foods for energy. People with type 1 diabetes must take daily insulin injections to survive. This form of diabetes usually develops in children or young adults, but can occur at any age. Type 2 (formerly called adult-onset or non insulin-dependent) diabetes results when the body doesn’t produce enough insulin and/or is unable to use insulin properly (insulin resistance). This form of diabetes usually occurs in people who are over 40, overweight, and have a family history of diabetes, although today it is increasingly occurring in younger people, particularly adolescents."

How can I study without being os stressed out?","Ok you need to study in small sessions, and anything most important right before you go to bed. Study for 20-30 minutes, take a 10 minutes break, 20-30 minutes, 10 minute break. Studies show this helps the brain most. Also, study actively. For example, don't just read over something, make a game out of it, or have someone quiz you on it.  Always get 8 hours of sleep, eat healthy foods and plenty of fresh fruits and vegetables, and make sure you start studying at least 1.5-2 weeks before your exams. Make little notecards so you can quiz yourself in those odd moments like on the bus or in line at the store or where ever. If you also re-write key concepts, that helps your brain remember them better. Even if you have a scantron test, know the concept well enough to write an essay so that you are more prepared than you need to be."

I don't care if it lasts 6 weeks, if I have to color every 4 weeks.  Or does permanent color cover better?","Semi-permanant color lasts up to 6 weeks. That just means that it will fade off a little bit. You cannot control how much your hair grows.  It grows a 1/2 inch every monthy on average. Therefor, you will always need to color it every 4 to 6 weeks. To keep your hair healthier, I would suggest that you see a professional because it is relaxing and easier, plus everyone can tell if you color your own hair. Trust me. If you keep doing it at home, then do a retouch when needed and on the 2nd time that you would retouch the roots, pull the color to the rest of your hair the last 5 minutes to refresh it. You can use whatever you prefer too-semi or permanant.  I would use permanant to prevent fading. And don't forget a color safe shampoo! Hope this helps!"

"7","Should I Be Worried!  Please Help - About to Purchase Condo?","Ok, first thanks for reading this question.\n\nMy wife and I purchased a Condo Last Year in Chicago for 360k, this Condo was under construction and will be ready in July.  We already gave 36K deposit for earnest money which will be used as down payment.  We plan on putting another 36k at least to make 20% down.  We might put more down, maybe even 100k total.\n\nWe make combine 70K and have a combined credit score of about 680 -\n\nMy question is - do we qualify for a traditional 30 year fixed at a good interest rate?  Is it even possible to do a 15 year fixed with our income. \n\nI'm a little worried we will not qualify for a loan because of our low combine income(70K).  \n\nThe condo has 3 bedrooms so we plan on renting 2 of them out for 1000k a month to help out with the mortgage (do lenders consider rental money and should I even mention it?)\n\nThanks for any help =)","First of all what you need to do is go get yourself pre-approved for a mortgage!!!  That should have been the very first step before you even started looking at condos. I'm surprised any lenders would accept such a deposit without approving you completely for the loan!\n\nNext, 680 is fairly average for a credit score (not great, but definitely not bad). They will mainly take that score into consideration for your interest rate (which could really only fluctuate about .3 percent). Income level is good, but considering the cost of the condo, combined with other expenses (car payments, insurance, taxes, credit cards, any other loans or pre-existing monthly bills), I could say with confidence that 15 year mortgage is NOT the way to go. \n\nThey won't take the rent for the other bedrooms into consideration, unless you have a lease signed by tenants, and the income is GUARANTEED to come in. Otherwise, who knows if you'll really find someone to rent those out or how long it will take TO find someone. \n\nTalk to your real estate agent (and please tell me you have one with such an expensive condo). Figure out your finances and GOOD LUCK! :)"
"9","Am I the Maid of Honor or not??","My best friend is getting married. While talking about weddings one day, before she got engaged, she said that when she get married, I would be her maid of honor. She's now planning her wedding, and we talk about it at work all the time. My problem lies here... When over at a friend's house, I heard her sister say that she was walking down the isle with Ryan, which is the best man. My friend hasn't said that I wasn't going to be her maid of honor. I don't know if her sister is just assuming she's the maid of honor or if my friend really asked her? I don't know how to bring it up. Any suggestions?","It's a sensitive subject, but I say ask.  Being Maid of Honor isn't some achievement of a lifetime, but it is important.  There are things that the Maid of Honor normally helps take care of (bridal shower, bachelorette parties, random errands, etc.)  You don't want her thinking you are her Maid of Honor, but you're not planning certain things because you're not sure.  And just say that. ""I need to know so I can get started.  If not, that's ok, but I want to be clear.""  I know, I had a similar problem when my husband proposed.  One of my friends thought she was going to be MOH and when I didn't say that, she asked me.  I answered, crisis averted, and she still danced at my wedding."
"6","Can anyone give me some advice or point me to a website where I can learn how to start fishing, as a hobby?","","You'd be surprised at how easy it is to start, you don't need anything fancy, just a pole, bait, and a good spot. You can probably pick out a good pole easily with the advice of any Wal-Mart associate. My best advice would be to go to a sporting goods store, like cabelas, or gander mtn. sports, and see if they have any clinics where you can learn the basics. It's easy to figure out on your own, but cheaking up on things like this will greatly improve your luck when you get out there. For spots reasearch the department of environmental conservation (DEC) where they should list public land for fishing. Also almost everytime you're on a road that follows a stream, and there's a parking area, you can fish, or get permission to fish from a landowner. Good luck with it!"

"7","What is the best health insurance plan for someone who is self employed?","Oregon","If you want a national plan (in the event you do a significant amount of travel) then you might want to use Blue Cross or Medica.  I would suggest looking at a plan that has a deductible that is at least $1,500 for a single person or $3,000 for a family.  This will keep the premium costs lower and also qualify you for contributions into an HSA (Health Savings Account).  These contributions are pre-tax and can be withdrawn and used tax free for qualified medical expenses.  \nThis type of strategy saves you premium costs and taxes.  If you or a family member who will be on the plan has a large amount of health care expenses per year, you might do better to consider a lower deductible.  The increased premiums might be less expensive than the out of pocket expenses if you are more likely to use more services or ongoing prescription medications that are expensive."

The turtle plods along dutifully, but is consistently confronted with danger and setbacks. Significantly, the dangers posed to the turtle are those of modernity and business. It is the intrusion of cars and the building of highways that endanger the turtle. The truck that strikes it is a symbol of big business and commerce.

Ok here goes......\n\n (Ok now am I allowed to have fun with it or do I have to attack it seriously? Ok....we'll see what comes out)\n\nA sociopath obviously will have anti social behavior. For what reasons? Numerous! But a sociopath many times withdraws from society because of hating themselves. Ok something in society could have brought them to this conclusion, but many have been known to be so unhappy with who they are that they remove themselves from any and all social relationships and contact.\n\nNarcissists on the other hand (ok say that three times fast)have an abundance of self adoration! However, they become so preoccupied and fixated upon themselves that they develop a lack of awareness of others. They lack empathy toward others as they fall out of sync with societal gestures of kindness and generosity and sincere concern. However, I don't believe they become anti-social. They have a need to point out to others their fine attributes. It is not enough to love thyself........they must make sure others accept them in the same way. Perhaps society shuns them for this just enough to make them feel the need to love themselves in a way no one else seems to. \n\nNow as I said in the beginning.......there are NUMEROUS reasons we fall into the categories of sociopathic and narcissistic behaviors. All cases are different. So my answer is...........No...not always. (and oftentimes not)\n\nOk......when I started off I was so going to make this funny.

This word was formed by joining ""sub,"" below or in some cases, at the foot of or at, with the word ""limen,"" which means limit, threshold or door. Thus sublime means ""at the limit"" and subliminal means ""below the threshold"" or something like that.

"10","What is Direct election?? o__O;?","I have a stupid homework question that asks when the heck a direct election is. Thats my question! @___@","Direct election is a term describing a system of choosing political officeholders in which the voters directly cast ballots for the person, persons or political party that they desire to see elected. The method by which the winner or winners of a direct election are chosen depends upon the electoral system used. The most commonly used systems are the plurality system and the two round system for single winner elections, such as a presidential election, and party-list proportional representation for the election of a legislature.\n\nBy contrast in an indirect election, the voters cast elect an assembly which in turn elects the officeholder in question. Some examples of indirectly elected bodies would include:\n\nthe Parliamentary Assemblies of the Council of Europe, OSCE, the WEU and NATO - in all of these cases, voters elect national parliamentarians, who in turn elect some of their own members to the assembly \nthe election of the government in most parliamentary systems - the voters elect the parliamentarians, who then elect the government from among themselves \nthe German Bundesrat, where voters elect the Landtag members, who then elect the state government, which then appoints its members to the Bundesrat \nthe election of the US President is technically indirect -- the voters elect the electoral college, who then elects the President -- although in practice it resembles a direct election for most purposes \nmost bodies formed of representatives of national governments, e.g. the United Nations General Assembly, can be considered indirectly elected (assuming the national governments are democratically elected in the first place, which is often not the cause)"

"3","Is lupus hereditary?","","Lupus is a chronic autoimmune disease in which the immune system turns against the body and harms healthy cells and tissues. Lupus, which is also considered a rheumatic (arthritic) disease, can affect many parts of the body including the joints, skin, kidneys, lungs, heart or brain. Some of the most common symptoms include extreme fatigue, painful or swollen joints, unexplained fever, skin rashes, and kidney problems.\n\nWe don’t know yet what causes the immune system to become overactive. Scientific evidence indicates that lupus is caused by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Studies show that lupus runs in families, meaning that certain genes predispose you to the disease. Environmental triggers may include ultraviolet light, bacterial and viral infections, medications, diet and stress. \n\nAccording to the National Institutes of Health, nine out of ten people who have lupus are women. It often first appears during the childbearing years—ages 15 to 45. Lupus is three times more common in African American women than in Caucasian women, and is also more common in women of Hispanic, Asian, and Native American descent. \n\nLupus is not contagious. You cannot give it to someone else.\n\nThere currently is not a cure for lupus and treatments may have serious side effects. The Alliance for Lupus Research hopes that more intensive research will lead to better treatments and a cure.

"5","Why can't I access my yahoo e-mail account?","","There are many reasons why you cannot access your e-mail account, although I have noticed that Yahoo will randomly take accounts off line for anywhere from 1 to 3 weeks, especially if they see that there isn't very much activity on those accounts.\n\nPerhaps they do this if they're uploading new ads, or if one of their servers is having some problems. They have been known to disable certain accounts for awhile, although they usually put those accounts back on line within 3 weeks or thereabouts. Of course, they're certainly not going to admit to doing this, as you could imagine the number of complaints they would receive!\n\nOutside of that scenario, double check your username and password for spelling errors, as typos are the most common reason why people cannot access their e-mail accounts."

Pacquiao (born December 17, 1978), aka ""Pacman"" and ""The Destroyer"" is the reigning WBC International Super Featherweight Champion (2005–present), former RING People's Featherweight Champion (2003 to 2005), former IBF Super Bantamweight Champion (2001 to 2004), and former WBC Flyweight Champion (1998 to 1999). He has a record of 41 wins, 3 losses, and 2 draws, with 34 wins coming by way of knockout.\n\n[edit]\nBiography\nPacquiao was born in the province of Bukidnon in the Philippines. It is not certain whether he started selling bread called ""pan de sal"" on the streets or made it as a bread maker or a ""panadero"" who makes different kinds of breads including the ""pan de sal"". There are news items that link him to being cocky in bars, starting fights but that part of his personality may have faded as evident of his closeness to God (as a Catholic) on recent interviews as well as his religious gestures before and after a fight.\n\n[edit]\nCareer\nThe boxer, who hails from General Santos City, Philippines is also dubbed ""The Destroyer"" by his peers in the boxing world. He has ended many of his fights with his left punch.\n\nThe 27-year-old Pacquiao started his professional boxing career in 1995 at 106 pounds. He bounced in weight from 106 to 113 pounds before losing in his 12th fight against Rustico Torrecampo via third round technical knockout. Shortly after the Torrecampo fight Pacquiao settled in at 112 pounds, winning the WBC Flyweight title only to lose it in his second defense against Medgoen Singsurat by third round knockout. Theoretically speaking, Pacquiao may have lost the belt at the scales by not being able to make weight of 112 lb (51 kg).\n\nFollowing the loss to Singsurat, Pacquiao again jumped in weight, this time stopping at the Super Bantamweight division of 122 lb (55 kg) where he picked up the WBC International title, defending it five times before his next world title fight came. Pacquiao’s big break came on June 23rd, 2001, against IBF Super Bantamweight champion Lehlohonolo Ledwaba. Pacquiao stepped into the fight as a late replacement and walked out of the fight the newly crowned IBF Super Bantamweight champion. Pacquiao scored three knockdowns before the end of the fight was called in the fifth round.\n\n \nPacquiao wobbles Erik Morales.Manny went on to defend his title four times before the match that many consider to have defined his career, against his childhood boxing idol, Marco Antonio Barrera of Mexico came. Pacquiao rose from an official knockdown in the first round, and won the fight by technical knockout, when Barrera’s corner stopped the fight in the eleventh round. With this victory, the ""Pacman"" captured the WBO and Ring Magazine People's Featherweight Title, as Barrera had beaten Naseem Hamed previously for that belt. Pacquiao's performance established himself, according to many critics, fans and boxing magazines alike, as one of the best pound-for-pound boxers in the world, and put the Philippines on the boxing world's map again where he follows in the\nfootsteps of past Filipino boxing stars such as ""Flash Elorde"", Ben Villaflor, and\nPancho Villa, among others.\n\n \nPacquiao knocks down Erik Morales.Only six months removed from his win over Marco Antonio Barrera, Pacquiao went on to challenge another respected Mexican boxer, Juan Manuel Marquez, holder of the WBA and IBF Featherweight Title. Experts predicted that Marquez, a dangerous counter-puncher, would prevail over Pacquiao because of his apparently superior boxing skills. The fight turned out to be one of the greatest Featherweight clashes in the history of boxing. Pacquiao's handspeed and punching power was displayed early as he stormed Marquez with jabs and straight lefts that sent the Mexican Champion to the canvas three times in the first round alone. It looked as if Pacquiao was on his way to "

"3","what side effects can zonegran have on a unborn child?","","The use of Zonegran (zonisamide) by pregnant women hasn't been fully studied, but there are serious concerns based on studies using animals. When it was given to pregnant mice, rats, and dogs early in pregnancy, there were high rates of fetal abnormalities, especially heart defects and skeletal malformations. After it was given to monkeys during certain stages of pregnancy, many of the fetuses died, possibly because of malformations. All of these effects occurred at doses (and blood levels in the mother) that were equivalent to the amounts used to treat epilepsy in humans, or sometimes even lower. There was also a higher rate of death among the offspring of rats who were given zonisamide late in their pregnancy. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has labeled Zonegran as ""Pregnancy Category C"" and recommends that women who could possibly become pregnant should use effective birth control while using Zonegran. Recognizing that seizures in the mother also may be hazardous to a fetus, however, they conclude that the risks and benefits must be weighed in considering the use of Zonegran during pregnancy. Tell your doctor right away if you are pregnant or thinking about becoming pregnant."

Diet and exercise are an excellent first step to lower cholesterol.\nYou should talk to your family doctor that will help you to choose your diet carefully and please read the information on these sites.\n\nLifestyle Changes\n\nExercise: Although not everyone can run, burning between 1,200 and 1,500 calories each week doing aerobic exercise can have dramatic results. Not only is exercising a wonderful way to keep your heart healthy, it also helps lose weight, which is an additional benefit. By losing 10 pounds of excess weight, according to Kokkinos, ""That's where you see significant increases in your HDL cholesterol.""\n\nAvoid Trans Fatty Acids: Avoid trans fatty acid containing foods such as French fries, cookies, cakes and many of the fried fast foods.\n\nMinimize Carbohydrates: Minimize carbohydrates by avoiding sugar, flour, potatoes and white rice. Studies prove that HDL level drops dramatically when blood sugar is spiked by carbohydrates.\n\nAvoid Cholesterol Foods: Minimize the food sources of cholesterol such as egg yolk, liver, kidney, brains, etc.\n\nStop Smoking: According to a study at Vanderbilt, within just one week of quitting smoking, HDL levels raised by seven points.\n\nHDL or Good Cholesterol Foods\n\nRed Wine: Drinking red wine is yet another option as long as it is consumed within reason. ""There are antioxidants contained in red wines such as cabernet sauvignon, Merlot, and pinot noir, that help slow down the oxidation of HDL and LDL cholesterol"", according to Vincent Rifici of the Robert Wood Johnson Medical School. What was shown is not that the HDL was higher than those not drinking, but that the HDL contained higher levels of several types of blood fats, thus giving the positive result. There is still a lot more research required but this could prove to be a wonderful option.\nOrange Juice: There was one specific study conducted at the University of Western Ontario in Canada where 25 students drank orange juice every day for four week. The results were amazing. HDL was raised an astounding 21%. The individual leading this study, Elzbieta Kurowska, stated this increase might have been caused by the flavonoid in the orange juice.\n\nBeans: Kidney and red beans are a wonderful choice for raising HDL. These foods are low-glycemic carbohydrates that during digestion do not cause insulin spikes. Studies conducted where people ate foods rich in low-glycemic carbohydrate measure with the highest level of HDL.\n\nFish: Fish eaten several times a week can also be beneficial in raising HDL since it contains omega-3 fatty acids. This fish would include sardines, salmon, sea bass, herring, etc. If you do not like to eat fish, fish oil can be used as a supplement although the benefit takes much longer.\nOlive Oil: Use oils higher in mono-unsaturated fats, such as olive oil or canola oil. Including 1-2 teaspoons of olive or canola oil with each meal would be sufficient.\n\nOat bran: Lowers cholesterol and LDL and raises HDL. In one study, two ounces of oat bran per day was associated with a 16% lowering of LDL and, after 3 months, an increase in HDL of as much as 15% (JAMA. 1991. 285. 1833-1839).\n\nOnions: Some research suggests that half of raw onion/day may raise HDL as much as 30%.\n\nSoy Products: A 1995 meta-analysis of 38 studies of soy confirmed that it lowers total cholesterol, LDL (""bad"") cholesterol, and triglycerides, and raises HDL (""good"") cholesterol.\n\nSoluble Fiber: Add more soluble fiber to diet. Soluble fiber is found in fruits such as apples, grapes, and citrus fruits. The fiber in these foods helps lower total cholesterol and often raises HDL levels. You need to consume at least 30 grams of fiber per day.\n\n\n\nhttp://www.loweringcholesterol.net/show/raise-hdl-cholesterol\nhttp://www.americanheart.org/presenter.jhtml?identifier=4488"

Honey, it just doesn't make sense.  He's your boss and he's holding all the cards.  Why do you think there are sexual harrassment laws?  Because the emotional factors will make a mess of the employment factors if you let them, and I can't imagine any good coming out of the very idea.\n\nThe problem may be your concept of ""being in love.""  Do you think this is something purely emotional, uncontrollable?  It's not.  If you decide you can't afford to love someone, that there's no realistic prospect for happiness in it, you can refuse to give in to love.  You can like, admire, admit you think he's attractive, all that; but love is something you have to be able to control, to decide.  And deciding to love your married boss is the height of stupidity, in my estimation."

"7","why hasn't the productivity derived from high technology shortened the working day and week?","","Well, the working week has decreased dramatically over the past century.  In 1906, a 16 hour day was considered normal, and our consumer culture hadn't evolved to have anything resembling a weekend.  The reason we don't see even shorted periods is because our technology allows us to do more work in less time, meaning that 8 hours today can achieve, hypothetically speaking, 10 hours of work from the past. If we cut the number of hours, we would be loosing out on overall productivity.  Some can blame this on greed of 'the corporations', but if you step off the soap box and take an objective look at our marvelously complex, comfortable and highly advanced society, you'll see that many of the things you take for granted simply would not exist if economic productivity decreased in such a way."

Dividend grows at 6.17% (1.005^12-1).  It would be $21.77\n\nThe second stage is 100% payout of earnings.  Assuming earnings grow at the same rate, the Year 6 earnings would be  $12.70 at which point, it is an instrument paying perpetual dividend at the same rate.  At the cap rate, that means the price at Year 5 is $141.17 (12.70/0.09) which when discounted at 9% is $91.75 (141.17/(1.09^5)).\n\nAdd these two values to get the stock price = 91.75 + 21.77 = 113.52"

"1","Have you ever communicated with some one that passed away a few hours before?","","Yes, many times. It seems that I am the spiritual gatekeeper for the family. My grandmother visited me for a full six months after her passing; I finally had to ask her to stop since I wasn't getting any sleep because of it! The only two people in my entire family who have not made personal visits are my Dad's mother &, believe it or not, my Dad. I did see him once in connection with my mother's Dad & believe that I learned why I haven't been visited by him, alone, but am still not certain that I understood what was happening perfectly.\n\nIf this happens to you, try to go with the flow as it is a very powerful gift &, once your family understand that it happens to you, one that can bring a measure of peace to those who are grieving. Just don't be surprised if most people don't understand it or claim that they don't believe it as this is perfectly normal for those who have never had it happen to them personally.\n\nWhat has happened over the course of my life & losses is that my family - while some of them still don't fully believe that this happens to me - has come to be the realization that I am wise beyond my years. To clarify, there are things that I have said or done in relation to information that has been passed on to me that there is no other explanation for but, since some members of the family choose not to believe that I've been contacted, they pay respect to my talent by their belief that I am ""wise"".\n\nPersonally, I have learned to phrase anything I might say to the family in ways that tend to indicate that it could have been prior knowledge. This helps ease them into the idea that I know some things that they know fully well I shouldn't be aware of. I've learned to phrase what I know from contacts with the family who has passed in such a way as to present it as logical...""I wouldn't think that Grandma would - whatever - since she never liked - whatever..."" This also helps to add information to the conversation & get the point across while not drawing attention to what I tend to call my ""ether"" knowledge.\n\nI don't really blame some of my family for having problems, however. After all, it is hard enough on one of my uncles that I now look exactly like his mother...add to this that my voice has the same timber, I have the same type of personality & such & it is easy to understand his issues with my other talents :) Poor man nearly fainted the first time I walked into his house & he saw me with glasses...\n\nEdited for Fred: Are you okay or are you intentionally rude because you have the strange idea that it is funny?

Most Americans practice some version of Christianity.  Of course there are large Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist and other religious groups that make-up the true fabric and character of this place.  Many friends of mine are Muslim.  When Ramadan arrives, I wish them 'Happy Ramadan'.  For my Jewish friends, it's 'Happy Hanukkah' and so forth.  What bothers me about this political correctness we seem to be stuck on is that it does not take into account how intelligent the average person is.  The only people I know of that are offended by Merry Christmas are big idiots.  If someone said Happy Hanukkah or Happy Ramadan or any other seasonal greeting I wouldn't take offense.  Heck, I would be happy that people of whatever faith or culture thought enough of me to grace me with a sweet greeting! In America December 25th is a major holiday called Christmas!

This happens sometimes outside the pattern of behavior within which you know them.\n\nUnder certain conditions or situations where you may be somewhat unfamiliar with their character they may act, or re-act in a foreign way to you. That is a fact about people....all people.\n\nThis is one reason why parents often plead and beg with their kids to get to know someone before; having sex, moving in together, working together, getting married, etc etc.\n\nSo you have a good solid understanding of their actions and feel safe with how they do things. It's not a fail-safe, but it's all you have.\n\nYou have to learn how to hone your instincts and trust in other people. People predate upon one another. It's a shame, but it happens.\n\nSo, you can say then that your friend wasn't *really* a friend. That you chose to allow them to be in the role of your friend, and that you did so too quickly without taking enough time to really know them.\n\nConniving people will ingratiate themselves to you for many reasons.\n\nThese are lessons in life that one can never master. No matter what age, we make mistakes, but the key is to learn and become wise, not bitter or vengeful.\n\nSorry this happened to you, but learn from it and move on. Find and cultivate a new friend.\n\n:)"

It may be just the default settings we're dealing with here, or it might even be the result of a funky extension causing some issues. Either way, though, I'm going to tell you how I've got my browser set up to handle links that open in a new window (e.g. pop-ups). Of course it's first important to distinguish that these pop-ups you describe are the good pop-ups. I mean you probably still want Firefox to block the JavaScript pop-ups from showing. No problem, however, because my method won't bother those settings! So, deep breath. Here we go.\n\nFirst, read up on editing your user.js file at [1]. Next, download and place the following file from [2] in your profile folder. Make sure Firefox is closed when doing this. Now, open FF again.\n\nLastly, go to Tools -> Options and then select the Tabs panel. You should be able to see a setting that says ""Force links that open new windows to open in:"".

"10","russia romanov empire?","about russia romanov empire that happened before world war 1","Romanov (rō'mənŏf, Rus. rəmä'nəf) , ruling dynasty of Russia from 1613 to 1917. The name Romanov was adopted in the 16th cent. by a family of boyars (great nobles) that traced its beginnings to the 14th cent. Czar Ivan IV took as his first wife Anastasia Romanov. Anastasia's brother, Nikita, was a regent for her son, Czar Feodor I. Nikita's son, Philaret, whom Boris Godunov forced to take monastic vows, was patriarch of Moscow from 1619 until his death in 1633. Michael, Philaret's son, was chosen in 1613 as czar of Russia; his election ended a turbulent period in Russian history. Except for the period from 1722 to 1797, the succession was thereafter regulated by the law of primogeniture.\nThe direct successors of Michael were Alexis (1645–76) and Feodor III (1676–82). Ivan V and Peter I (Peter the Great) reigned jointly under the regency of their sister Sophia Alekseyevna until 1689, when Peter assumed sole rule. In 1721, Peter took the title emperor of Russia in addition to that of czar; the new title was borne by all his successors. His succession decree of 1722 denounced the law of primogeniture and declared that the choice of a successor lay solely with the ruling emperor.\n\nIn 1723, Peter made his consort joint ruler as Catherine I, and after his death (1725) she continued to rule until she died in 1727. Peter's son by his first marriage, Czarevich Alexis, had been executed in 1718. His second marriage, with Catherine, produced two daughters: Anna, who married Duke Charles Frederick of Holstein-Gottorp, and Elizabeth. They were bypassed in the succession of 1727 in favor of Peter II (1727–30), son of Czarevich Alexis.\n\nPeter II was the last of the direct male Romanov line, and on his death Anna, duchess of Courland, a daughter of Ivan V, ascended the throne. She died without heirs and was succeeded (1740) by Ivan VI, a great-grandson of Ivan V. He was a German, son of the duke of Brunswick and of Anna Leopoldovna, a princess of Mecklenburg.\n\nThe rule of foreigners was unpopular, and Peter I's daughter Elizabeth executed a coup in 1741 and was proclaimed czarina. Her nephew Peter III succeeded her in 1762 but was deposed (and probably assassinated) that year in a coup that made his consort, a princess of Anhalt-Zerbst, empress as Catherine II (Catherine the Great). There was some argument as to the paternity of Catherine's son and successor, Paul I (1796–1801), but it is now generally believed that he was the son of Peter III.\n\nPaul, who was assassinated, restored the succession by primogeniture in 1797. His successors reigned as Alexander I (1801–25), Nicholas I (1825–55), Alexander II (1855–81; assassinated), Alexander III (1881–94), and Nicholas II (1894–1917). The marriage of Nicholas II to Princess Alix of Hesse (Czarina Alexandra Feodorovna) brought hemophilia into the family; their son, Czarevich Alexis (1904–18), was afflicted with the disease. In 1918, after the Russian Revolution, Nicholas II and his immediate family were executed. The members of the Romanov family who escaped execution fled abroad."

The Constitution of India and general usage also recognises Bharat (Hindi: भारत IPA: /bɦaːrət̪/  listen?), which is derived from the Sanskrit name of an ancient Hindu king, whose story is to be found in the Mahabharata, as an official name of equal status. A third name, Hindustan (Hindi: हिन्दुस्तान IPA: /ɦɪn̪d̪ʊst̪aːn/)  listen?, or Land of the Hindus in Persian, has been used since the twelfth century, though its contemporary use is unevenly applied due to domestic disputes over its representiveness as a national signifier."

The more humidity in the air, the less sweat evaporating from you skin and thus the hotter (and stickier) it feels."
"4","Was Muawiya the founder of the Sunni branch of Islam, if so where can i find a biography that includes both?","I've already found one biography from about 5 sites and i need different one.

(I have to have this for today, so if u are posting an answer after today, exclude this question. Plz and thankies.","Muawiya was not the founder of Sunni denomination of Islam. (See below)\n\nWith 940 million adherents, Sunni Islam is the largest denomination of Islam. Followers of the Sunni tradition are known as Sunnis or Sunnites; they sometimes refer to themselves as Ahlus Sunnah wal-Jamaa'h, ""adherents to the Sunnah and the assembly.""\n\nSunnis have their historical roots in the majority group who followed Abu Bakr, an effective leader, as Muhammad's successor, instead of his cousin and son-in-law Ali. The Sunnis are so named because they believe themselves to follow the sunnah or ""custom"" of the Prophet.\n\nAlgeria has nearly 99% Sunni Muslims (Sunni Islam is the state religion), Kuwait has 70% and Afghanistan has a majority of Sunni muslims (around 80%). Sunni Muslims also outnumber Shi'ite Muslims in Israel, Egypt, Turkey, Somalia, Uzbekistan, Sudan (70%), Syria (80%), Tajikistan (85%), Libya (97%), Jordan (92%) and certain islands like the Maldives, Comoros (98%) and the Cocos (Keeling) Islands (80%). Iraq has 45-60% of Sunni Muslims, who are concentrated mostly in the central & northern parts of the country. Sunni Muslims are a minority in Iran (10%) and Bahrain (30%).\n\nSunnis base their religion on the Quran and the Sunnah as understood by the majoroty of the community under the structure of the four schools of thought. The four Sunni schools of law (madhahib) - the Hanafi, the Maliki, the Shafi'i and the Hanbali - are sometimes mistakenly understood as different sects, but they are not. These four schools of religious law associate themselves with four great scholars of early Islam: Abu Haneefah, Malik, Shafi'i, and Ahmad bin Hanbal. These scholars were known for their knowledge and piety throughout the Muslim world. They differed only in minor issues of application of certain principles in the religion and were not in opposition to each other. In fact, Ahmad bin Hanbal was a student of Shafi'i, who was a student of Malik.\n\nSufism is considered by the majority of Sunnis to be integral part of Sunni Islam. It deals with the spiritual aspects of a Sunni Muslim's everyday life. Some of the most famous Sufi schools are the Qadiri, Naqshbandi, Shadhili, Chishti, and Rifa‘i paths or tariqas.\n\nSunnis view the Shi'ites as from the ahlul-bidah; i.e., the people of innovation. Sunnis oppose Shi'ite beliefs concerning some of the companions of the Prophet, the belief in the Imamate and difference on the Caliphate, and others. Other groups considered to be outside Islam by Sunnis are Nation of Islam, Ahmadiyya, and Ismailis.\n\nShia Islam includes most of the Muslims that are not counted among the Sunni. The primary division within Islam, between Sunni and Shi'a, dates to the death of the Prophet Muhammad when his followers were faced with the decision of who would be his successor as the leader of Islam. Shi'ites are those who followed Ali, the closest relative of Muhammad, as Muhammad's successor. Today there are approximately 120 million Shi'ite Muslims in the world.\n\nThe Shia consist of one major school of thought known as the Jafaryia or the ""Twelvers,"" and a few minor schools of thought, as the ""Seveners"" or the ""Fivers."" These names all refer to the number of imams they recognize after the death of Muhammad. The term Shi'a is usually meant to be synonymous with the Jafaryia/Twelvers.\n\nThe Origins of the Sunni/Shia split in Islam\nAli is the central figure at the origin of the Shia / Sunni split which occurred in the decades immediately following the death of the Prophet in 632. Sunnis regard Ali as the fourth and last of the ""rightly guided caliphs"" (successors to Mohammed (pbuh) as leader of the Muslims) following on from Abu Bakr 632-634, Umar 634-644 and Uthman 644-656. Shias feel that Ali should have been the first caliph and that the caliphate should pass down only to direct descendants of Mohammed (pbuh"
"2","suppose A is a set of formulas and every finite subset of A is satisfiable, then A is satisfiable.?","prove this\n\nsatisfiable means that for every finite subset of A, there is a unique truth assignment that will make the subset of formulas true. \n\nalso, why is the intersection of the finite subsets and the truth assignments nonempty? \n\nthis is for my Math 451 class at UNLV","There are many proofs, for example via Boolean algebras or compact Hausdorff topological spaces or binary trees and probably more.\n\nFor example, consider the sequence S0, S1, S2, ..., of sets of truth assignments, such that:\n\n a) S0 is the set of all truth assignments\n b) S1 is a subset of S0, S2 is a subset of S1, S3 is a subset of S2, etc.\n c) For every finite subset E of A, every Sn contains at least one truth assignment that satisfies E\n\nNote that by assumption, S0 satisfies condition (c).\n\nEnumerate the propositional letters as p0, p1, p2, ...\n\nGiven that Sn satisfies (c), construct S{n+1} as follows:\n\n let Fn = { truth assignments in Sn such that the value assigned to letter pn is FALSE }\n let Tn = { truth assignments in Sn such that the value assigned to letter pn is TRUE  }\n\nClaim: at least one of Fn and Tn must satisfy clause (c).\n\nWhy?  Suppose that both E1 is a finite subset of A with no satisfying assignment in Fn and E2 is a finite subset of A with no satisfying assignment in Tn.  Then E1 union E2 is also a finite subset of A which can be seen to have no satifying assignment in Sn, contrary to our assumption about Sn.\n\nSo now we define\n\n S{n+1} = Fn if every finite subset of A has a satisfying assignment in Fn, otherwise S{n+1} = Tn\n\nThis way we define S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn, ... so that all Sn have property (c) and each S{n+1} is a proper subset of Sn.\n\nThere is one truth assignment in the intersection of all of the S0, S1, S2, ..., Sn, ....  Why? It is the assignment that assigns FALSE to pn if S{n+1} was Fn and TRUE to pn if S{n+1} was Tn.  It can be seen that both this truth assignment is in the common intersection of the Sn and that no other truth assignment can be.\n\nFinally, the one truth assignment in the common intersection of the Sn is a satifying truth assignment for all of the formulas in A.  I guess the easiest way to see this is that for any finite subset E of A (including the one-element subsets), all of the letters of the formulas in E are pi for 0 <= i < n.  Then since Sn already decides the FALSE or TRUE value of each pi, 0 <= i < n, we see that every truth assignment in Sn decides E the same way: all elements of Sn satify E or all elements of Sn do not satifsy E.  But at least one element of Sn must satisfy E -- so they all do, including the unique truth assignment in the common intersection of all of the Sn.\n\nSo A has at least one satisfying truth assignment.\n\n(You can find others by varying whether you pick Fn or Tn as the next S{n+1} whenever both have property (c)).\n\n\nUpdate: A few hours later I realized the above was essentially the same as saying:\n\nClaim: If A is a finitely satisfiable set of formulas and s is a formula, then at least one of A union { s }, A union { not s } is also finitely satisfiable.\n\nOtherwise there are finite subsets E1 and E2 of A such that neither E1 union { s ] nor E2 union { not s } can be satisfied, when clearly the finite subset E1 union E2 of A cannot be satisfied.\n\nSo in the above construction the sequence S0, S1, S2, ... corresponded to a sequence like for example\n\n A0 = A\n A1 = A0 union { not p0 } if that is finitely satisfiable, otherwise A0 union { p0 } (which then is, by the claim)\n A2 = A1 union { not p1 } if that is finitely satisfiable, otherwise A1 union { p1 } (which then is, by the claim)\n\n...where as before the propositional letters are p0, p1, p2, ....\n\nThen the union of all of the An is finitely satisfiable (because a finite subset would be contained in some finitely satisfiable An along the way) and in fact you can read off a satisfying truth assignment of the union of all of the An because for each letter the union contains either the letter (so assign it TRUE) or its negation (so assign it FALSE).\n\nSame proof, just a different way of looking at it."

The most important thing is rapid transport. Other items:\n1) universal precautions (it's contagious)\n2) oxygen, if needed\n3) IV fluids (don't delay transport)\n4) general supportive care\n5) unless the patient was elderly, or had known heart disease, a cardiac monitor wouldn't be needed\n\nThe window of treatment for bacterial meningitis is often a few hours. If treatment isn't started quickly enough, the patient won't survive. This is particularly true for young children.\n\nThe first responders (EMS, fire, police)will likely need to be treated with antibiotics."

"3","My son doesn't take his diabetes seriously, what are long term effects of high blood sugar?","","Patients with diabetes have higher mortality rates than nondiabetics regardless of sex, age, or affluence. Heart disease and stroke are the leading causes of death in these patients. All life-style and medical efforts should be made to reduce the risk for these conditions. \n\nPeople with type 2 diabetes are also subject to nerve damage (neuropathy) and abnormalities in both small and large blood vessels (vascular injuries) that occur as part of the diabetic disease process. Such abnormalities produce complications over time in many organs and structures in the body. Although these complications tend to be more serious in type 1 diabetes, they still are of concern in type 2 diabetes. People with diabetes should aim for fast blood glucose levels of less than 110 mg/dl and hemoglobin A1C or less than 7%. \n\nThe impact of these multiple health problems are of great concern, particularly with the dramatic increase in diabetes. Experts now estimate that over a third of people born in 2002 will eventually develop diabetes. \n\nThere are two important approaches to preventing complications from diabetes: \n\nIntensive control of blood glucose and keeping glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) levels below 7.0. This is proving to prevent complication due to vascular (blood vessel) abnormalities and nerve damage (neuropathy) that can cause major damage to organs, including the eyes, kidneys, and heart. \nManaging risk factors for heart disease. Evidence is increasing that control of blood glucose also helps the heart, but its benefits most likely occur over time. It is very important that people with diabetes control blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other factors associated with heart disease."

This is what you're seeing.  Certain laptop video cards in recent years do allow you to split your desktop so that you can see different views on each available screen.\nFrom looking at the general specs on IBM's website (see sources) it mentions a 16MB ATI Radeon 7500 video card.

"7","how to attend the interview and group discussion?","","Hi Gharsha,\n\nMy experience throughout group discussions is that you should demonstrate actively your mentality but with correctness and intelligence. Indeed, being relaxed and confident helps a lot, but not to the point they perceive you may be too comfortable or even arrogant. Yes, perceptions count and often they buy-in the wrong ones! \n\nWhen it comes to a personal interview is easier because you don’t have to compete, only to be honest and give the interviewer as much useful info as you can. Some questions are surprisingly ambiguous, e.g.: “talk me about you”. Don’t panic! You have to follow a coherent line, so sometimes is good for you to require a more specific question –keeping your nice smile-: “Oh, yes…like about how I look at myself? Or about my family? About my past, student experience? About my latest work experience?” Obviously the answers are free, but being a little bit more specific info helps you not to panic (and getting your mind in blank!). \n\nI guess the most difficult part comes when they ask you to talk about “future”. Great businessmen have warned me you’ve just to tell companies what they expect to listen. If you plan to study a master or doctorate in France within 2 years, probably they won’t hire someone who will quit the company in an early future, so don’t say it!!! You dream to work in that company, and you’ll be there the rest of your life working for them –that’s what they expect to listen. Despite the prior, make it clear you’re a person with ambitions and not mediocre –just keep your aces under your sleeves, gotcha?- They hire what they need, and… believe me, when you’re not useful to them anymore, it’d be real strange if they don’t fire you. For me, too, that’s a tough point, but hey, it’s globalization, and nowadays loyalty doesn’t exist at all, likely a multi-national company just buy a little company and then everybody’s out. \n\nAdditionally, is always interesting to ask about the performance, growing, development, career opportunities and: THE GOLDEN RULE: The salary and benefits package, always, always are discussed at the end of interviews or negotiations, don’t even mention it if they don’t touch that issue, wait at the end –when they seem to be so interested on you-. If the company is real good and you really project yourself staying there some time, you can always sacrifice a little money, exchanging it for experience, vitae, training or relationships in order to escalate to better positions-in that company or any other one-.\n\nI hope those tips helped you. Please pardon my English mistakes, but Spanish, Catalan and French really mix my mind up!\n\nGood luck, and tell me if you succeed!\n\nAlfonso"

"5","which is better: sims 2 or the sims(PC)?","","Sims 2 by far.\n\nOne of the best things is a more intelligent AI.  Your sims now are more likely to take care of needs (sleep, food, bathroom) then they were in the old one, so it means less ""babysitting"".  And they are much more likely to go to work or school on their own.\n\nThat is just one of many things that make Sims 2 a lot better then the original.  Add to that things like community lots and I wonder why anybody would want to continue to play the original."

Neurofibromatosis, pronounced Neuro-fi-bro-ma-to-sis, (NF for short), is a genetic disorder of the nervous system that causes tumors to form on the nerves anywhere in the body at any time. This progressive disorder affects all races, all ethnic groups and both sexes equally. NF is one of the most common genetic disorders in the United States, (one in every 3,000 to 4,000 births), even though not many people are familiar with it. There are two genetically distinct forms of NF, NF-1 and NF-2. The effects of NF are unpredictable and have varying manifestations and degrees of severity. \n\nThere is no known cure for either form of NF, even though the gene for both NF-1 and NF-2 have been identified. Currently, NF has no treatment other than the surgical removal of tumors which may some times grow back. \nNF is an autosomal dominant genetic condition, meaning you can not catch it from other people. Only 50% of those affected with NF have a prior family history of NF. If an individual does not have NF he/she can not pass it on to his/her children. NF is classified as a disease. Disease is so negative. NF is not contagious."
"10","If I am an army reservist that will not be ETS til 2012 how many times can I be deployed?","either voluntarily or involuntarily.. Also if u wanted to get deployed how could u do it faster.","aaronsdaddy is not really correct. In any 740 day period, any day a Guardsman/Reservist spends deployed (whether overseas or in the States) is called a ""high tempo day"". If you accumulate more than 400 ""high tempo days"" you become effectively non-deployable. If a deployment will take you over 400 ""high tempo days"" in the middle of the deployment, you greatly lessen your chances of being deployed.\n\nIt is still technically possible to be deployed with more than 400 high tempo days, but the general grade officers that be have to jump through so many hoops they have decided it is just easier to activate someone else who has the high tempo days available to rack up.\n\nIf you are a Reservist and you want to volunteer, just talk to your personnel sergeant. I guarantee you that he will hook you up. And if you want to go, let them know. Maybe someone else who doesn't want to go will owe you a kegger when you get back."

Since the bone cell (matrix) is a solid matter, it is not likely to convert to a liquid state with an acute increase in force (i.e., a fall). Possibly the immersion of the bone in moisture, or low pressure over a long period of time? In any case, a bone will not turn to a liquid state secondary to the impact from an acute blow or fall.

Let dry in a sheltered place. \nOnce dry simple contact will cause it to explode \n \nSafety - Note that this substance is an explosive.  Make sure no large lumps are left to dry on the filter paper.  Don't make too much touch power in one batch, and don't try to store it for later use.  Avoid getting these chemicals on skin or in eyes. \nExplanation - The precipitate created is Nitrogen tri-iodide.  This compound is very unstable and is extremely sensitive to pressure, and will explode at the slightest provocation (much like grade 9 students!) \nNotes - The ingredients in this demo are reasonably easy to get hold, even outside of the laboratory,  of so I would suggest not being too forth coming about their exact nature."

"3","What is the history of Herpes?","","The herpes infection has a history dating back to ancient Greece.  The word 'herpes' was used by Hippocrates to describe lesions that 'creep' or 'crawl.'  Although previously well characterized, it was not until 1893 that the transmissibility was recognized.6\n\nThe herpes family of viruses currently is thought to consist of herpes simplex 1 (HSV-1), herpes simplex 2 (HSV-2), varicella-zoster, Epstein-Barr, cytomegalovirus, and human herpes virus VI, VII, and VIII.5  All are capable of entering and replicating in epithelial cells, while some of the herpes family is neurotropic and others are lymphotropic.  HSV-1 and HSV-2 are neurotropic, infecting sensory nerve fibers and have been demonstrated to reproduce in epithelial cells.  HSV-1 and HSV-2 are lytic to human epithelial cells and latent in neural tissue at the site of regional ganglions.  Usually the virus initially enters the body through a break in the mucous membrane integrity, although there is evidence that it may penetrate intact skin.  In either case, transmission results from mucocutaneous contact with infected secretions and aerosols.  When reactivated, the virus travels along the nerve axon to the surface epithelial cells and can cause a recurrent epithelial outbreak.\n\nOften the initial herpes infection goes undetected.  However, in a small percentage of cases, the initial oral infection with HSV-1 or HSV-2 is acutely symptomatic causing many signs and symptoms detected by the patient.  When the patient demonstrates systemic signs, symptoms, and has perioral and intraoral vesicular lesions, it is referred to as primary herpetic gingivostomatitis.  Although the condition most often occurs in children, it can also affect adolescents and adults.  Fever and lymphadenopathy may occur, lasting from 2-10 days.  Pharyngitis, malaise, myalgia, fiery red gingival, and mucosal tissues associated with painful swallowing are hallmarks of the primary infection.  Intraorally, many small punctate ulcers may form on keratinized and nonkeratinized mucosa as well as at the nasopharynx.  Perioral tissues can also be affected.\nhttp://www.thejcdp.com/issue009/tilliss/10tillis.htm"

But when I ask you will the hurting stop and our loved ones be returned to us? I was in the marine corps for 5 years from 99 to 03, then the army from late 03 till last dec... So I've served my time and I've been to Afgan and Iraq, now i want this hell to stop, Is there anyone else???","The war that the terrorists started will end when the terrorists stop terrorizing people.

"10","Why every muslim had become terrorist in everybodies eyes?","","Well not every Muslim has become a terrorist in everybodies eyes. However Muslim people are being racially profiled because it saves time, money, and makes sense. Lets face it is not White, Black, Asians, Mexicans on and on that are straping bombs to themselves or crashing airplanes into buildings. I feel badly for the Muslim population that is being profiled but they should be thankfull they are not being interned like the Japenese during ww2. At the same time innocent people/journalist in their countries are being kidnaped and killed on video. The savage brutality of these senseless killings is very unnerving to America, especially when they film and mail it to us. (view videos at michaelsavage.com) Not to mention OBL keeps threatening us with sleepers. He is the biggest enemy of the average Muslim. My last point would be that there are no strong public speakers on behalf of the Muslims. I have been waiting for an intelligent well spoken Muslim to stand up and represent the American Muslim. I feel this would really help there cause."

The last mini-ice age that hit Europe and lasted for about 500 years was devastating to the population.  If this hits again and is as severe, how will the world cope with having to feed and house a starving Europe.","Yeah, I saw that on TV last night, due to a volcano erruption in Europe (we could also do this with nuck weapons)\n\nNot only would Europe be starving, but the America's (N & S), Africa, Asia, and Austrailia (wow, never noticed that most start with an A... anyway's) depending on the severity of it. \n\nSever: I guess humanity would degress to the dark ages (if we were really bad).  We'd probably slowly start to loose our technology, and after time, we'd be back in the dark ages.  Almost extinct if really bad (like an all out nuck war).  Humans have a big period of anmisia...during Christ's time, in the Alexandian libraray theologians had already come close to making steam engins, and flying macheins.  Somewhere, we experienced a change, which set us into the dark ages, so since history repeats itself, there u go.\n\nLow to Moderate: and if there was a continent that was able to produce food, I'd see the world community comming together and we would turn that area into a giant farm.

The bible is not persice when it comes to this matter so the do the early christian leaders do was genius. They want to mark a specific date to rebemer Jesus birth and they want to convert people aslo so.

Einstein said something like this: ""We used to think that if you took all of the matter and all of the energy out of the universe, all that would remain would be space and time.  Now we think that if you took all of the matter and all of the energy out of the universe, all of the space and all of the time would go with it"".

Do you think that most Christians believe that Wiccans and other witchcraft groups could poison young people to leave the church?","Where I live those of us who attend Open Circle in a public use park literally had to get a court order so we could evict people who were there to do nothign but harrass us because of our faith.  We have been called every foul name in the book and been accused of things that are wholy unbelievable.  Several us, after leaving one night, were followed by people who had a mic hooked up to a loudspeaker in their car and they trailed us shouting scripture and all manner of other things to us eventhough we ignored them and didn't say anything back.  By far these are the minority for sure but for the most part chruches do nothing to curb these so-called 'enthusiastic' members.  Leaders of churches have publicly denounced Wiccans and have called us the tools of the devil and denounced us from pulpits.  It seems that since Wicca has made a comeback it has become a favorite whipping boy of Christians.  For example, some of the worst things you can accuse someone of us practicing the occult.  When someone wants to denounce someone that is what they pull out.  Not that they are wrong or bad for other reasons but because they 'practice the occult'.  Most cults have been accused of it as well because they are religions they don't agree with.  Most major christan religions have warned of the danger of Wicca and the occult and saying it is nothing but the practice of the devil.  There are even entire books out there about the 'dangers of occult practices and how to keep your kids away from it or they may be sacrificing their soul'.  None of that sounds like tolerance to me, more like biggotry.  Yet none of the major christian factions have denounced this or tried to curb it in the name of tolerance.  Isn't silence in this matter as good and condoning it?\n\nWhereas, the difference is, Wiccans teach tolerance and acceptance of EVERYONE, no matter their religion, race, creed or sexual orientation. \n\nThink about it..."

Keeping plants healthy requires an understanding of the organisms and agents that cause disease as well as an understanding of how plants grow and are affected by disease. Through college courses in botany, microbiology, crop science, soil science, ecology, genetics, biochemistry, molecular biology, and physiology, students receive the necessary background for exciting careers in the interdisciplinary science of plant pathology.

"3","I recently developed an allergy to shrimp apparently. What else should I watch out for, if anything?","","You should watch out for shellfish, i.e. lobster, crab, mussels, and other seafood like squid, calamari, eel.  Seafood allergies can be life-threatening and tend to get worse with repeated exposure. I carry an epi-pen and have to have another person serve my food at buffets that have seafood. I avoid shaking hands with people if at an event where seafood is served.  The food allgergy and anaphalaxis network website has excellent resource and information including cards that you can carry with you when you go to dinner to pass on to the chef about your allergy."
"3","Are there any risks of all the immunizations doctors want to give my child?","","Usually not. Just get a list of proposed immunizations. Remember the second hep b vaccine some areas of the U.S. received? Well those specified areas had a rise in other acute illnesses. Only allow that which is of the norm and research any ""new"" proposed vaccination. Do what you feel is right, and chances are you can not go wrong. There are no stupid questions when health and safety are concerned."
"3","How long until I can return to running after dislocating my ankle?","","Best to ask your doctor, as individuals vary greatly in terms of healing time. But as a fellow runner, I will say this -- returning to running too quickly and intensely really increases the risk of you getting seriously injured the next time and putting you on the bench for a long time.\n\nIt's best to wait until your ankle feels completely well, no pain or weirdness when you walk around. Then, ease back into the running -- 15 minutes of running; 15 minutes of walking. Gradually build back up to where you were before. You may resent losing the time initially, but take it from me -- it's better than gaining the time now but losing WAY more on your second injury!"
"2","Do you really believe that we are at peak oil?","Also, do you believe that all of our natural resources come from fossil fuels.  Explain.","I do and I'm a petroleum geologist. It will be impossible to determine when we actually hit peak until we go down the other side for a while. Most of the major oil companies are failing to replace their annual production with new discoveries, in some cases only replacing 60% of the year's production. As oil becomes more expensive there will be more and more nonconventional sources like oil-shale that come on line, but they will only make the back side of the curve a little more gentle. \n\nThe bigger problem may be the growing demand. World oil demand is at an all time high, over 80 million bbls a day, and shows no signs of demand deflation. \n\nNo, all our resources are not fossil fuels. We need to explore EVERY alternative, including nuclear, solar, wind, bio, tidal, geothermal, etc. Realize that the world's second and third largest oil companies are also the world's two largest manufacturers of solar cells. One of those oil companies is also one of the largest wind power operators in the world. The oil companies see the handwriting on the wall. We need to start saving oil for some of the products other than fuel for which oil is the raw material."

It can provide local government services to its citizens.\n\nIn most places in the U.S. a town, village, community, or neighborhood is simply an unincorporated community with no governmental powers. Usually, county governments provide services to these unincorporated communities. Some states do have official designations of ""towns"" that include limited powers.\n\nGenerally in the urban heirarchy, villages are smaller than towns and towns are smaller than cities but each country has its own definition of a city and an urban area."

"2","Proofs in Advanced Calc (possibly Discrete math)?","Ok, I need to prove that sqrt(7) is an irrational number, and plug it into a calculator isnt a good answer, it needs to be somethign like the proof to sqrt(2) is irrational...but i am stuck.  Basically it needs to be a contridiction.  If anyone can help, point me in a direction, provide a website, anything at all it would be great.  Thanks!!","Proof by contradiction\nSuppose sqrt(7) is rational. Then it can be expressed and a fraction in reduced form, that is the numerator and denominator have no common factors.\n\nsqrt(7) = m/n.\n\nThus  7 = (m/n)^2 = m^2/n^2\n\n7n^2 = m^2\n\nSince 7 divides both sides, 7 has to divide m^2, so 7 must be of the form m = 7k for some integer k.\n\n7n^2 = (7k)^2 so we can factor a 7 out of both sides\n\nn^2 = 7 k^2. We repeat the arguement, now n has to be divisible by 7 so n = 7q for some integer q.\n\nso n = 7q, m = 7k, that says m and k both have 7 as a common factor a contradiction since m/n was a reduced fraction.\n\nThere for the assumptin that sqrt(7) is rational must be false."
"2","What causes the earth to rotate and orbit?","Why is the sky blue?","Our everyday experience teaches us that an object must be ""pushed"" by a force in order to keep it moving. Otherwise, it will slow down and eventually stop. But this intuition is absolutely wrong. If an object is moving, then a force is required *to slow it down or stop it*, not to keep it moving. (Hence, ""Objects in motion tend to stay in motion. Objects at rest tend to stay at rest."") In our everyday experience, it's the force of friction that tends to stop Earth-bound objects from moving forever. But for the Earth rotating on its axis, there is no force working to counteract the rotation (except the tidal effect of the Moon, but that's working very slowly), so you don't need to have any input energy to keep it spinning."

"1","Take it like a man? (real question inside!!)?","There has been some reserch suggesting that male babies were on average were far more emotional than female babies. Obivously this is interesting because in many cultures, male children are treated and conditioned different from females right from birth. Around the age of about 4 or 5 male children become significantly more aggressive than females.  Do you think that the repression their emotional feelings is truly what seperate men from women..because societally we want it that way? What are your thoughts on the subject?\n\n(I'll try to post the article as soon as I find it)","Honestly i blame the female population. Yes males are genetically inferior to female, we die easier when in an embryo and yes we are emotionally retarded in some aspects of life, such as color perception and taste, but at the end of the day i believe it comes down to sex. Not sexual intercouse, but the influence females have on males. The infamous aphorism ""behind every great man, thier's a female"" is given an entirely new meaning when, applied to society nowadays. As you stated early females suppress males in a lot of aspect. Studys have shown that females are mainly attracted to males of a more rough exterior, because during the ""primitive era"" those were the type of men that could hunt and provide, so forth and so on. Its because of this that females seek this in men, and a man seeking a female will alter his mannerism in ways to attract her. So yea, i feel what can lead to aggression is the suppression of our emotion, even though males have testosterone, so do females. Not as much, but testosterone none the less. And i'll tell you this, i've seen some pretty aggressive females to the point of it being scary, so genes can't take all the blame. At the end of the day, woman are the real creators of society, as a male im willing to say, that a lot of the things males strive for are in the pursuit for females."

"2","what is the application of totipotency in plant tissue culture?","","Totipotency is the theory that all plants should be able to reproduce a plant from a single cell.  This isn't true.  It really depends on what species of plant you take the tissue from , and where on the plant you got that tissue.  For instance, chances are that if you took xylem from a plant and retied to get a tissue culture to form, you would be out of luck, whereas leaves are probably a little more likely to respond favorably.  Ultimately though it depends on the horomones that are present in your culture medium- usually a mixture of auxins and cytokinins at a certain ratio."

"7","Why is it when people ask questions on this site people give them rude answers?","besides its really ticking me off!!!!!!!!","The psychology of the matter is this. Because when people are on the internet, there is no face to face communication. They can remain as anonymous as they desire. Hence such persons feel none of the inhibitions that are normally imposed by society on what is considered proper etiquette in conversation. Besides receiving rude words in return, there is no fear of severe consequences such as getting their face busted, nor do they have to see the facial expressions of the hurt they cause. Most people like this have poorly developed social skills to begin with. Either they are boorish cads, and their behavior is amplified by the nature of the internet, or they have pent-up anger that they are afraid to display in public, and lash out on the internet. People like this need to be dealt with firmly, but as the Scriptures say, ""answer a fool according to his folly, answer not a fool according to his folly."" In other words, expose such people as they fools they are, without resorting to their their tactics."

"1","who would agree with my that evolution has become a religion and should be seperate from statefunded education","","Not in the least.  Evolution is a scientific theory.  There are certainly atheist materialists that have tried to say that the only logical conclusion of evolution is atheism, but they are fools and liars, one and all.  The fact is that the tehory of evolution by natural selection is a) scientifically founded and b) not at odds with a belief in God.\n\nIf you don't agree with eveolution being taught, then quite frankly, you don't agree with the idea of teaching science at all.  It is all consostent with scientific methodology.  If that's the case, then oppose all science, and don't just pick-and-choose which findings you're going to take issue with.\n\n*********edit*********\nWHAT'S WITH THIS ""EQUAL TIME"" CRAP?!?!?  Would you guys suggest equal time for alchemy and chemistry?  For astrology and astronomy?  For Newtonian physics and psychokinetics?\n\nWhat you all are missing is that even if ID/Creationism is correct, it has NO USE TO HUMANS.  Period.  I cannot manipulate the theory of creationism to create a vaccine, the way I can manipulate evolution.  School is not about some sort of all-out investigation into Divine Truth; it is meant to be practical.  And like it or not, the theory of evolution by natural selection has practical applications.  We do not teach how to use the ALTAIR computer, because it's pointless; not because the functioning of it is any ""less true"" than the modern PC.  We do not teach basket weaving or bricklaying in school, because they have very little usefulness.  But every person who ever takes antibiotics or who ever uses a disinfectant on the kitchen counter can learn something useful about the nature of evolution.  This ""choice"" notion is utterly ridiculous.  Should phrenology be taught side-by-side with classical conditioning?  Should Swahili be taught with the same regularity that Spanish is taught?  You people are talking nonsense.\n\nDo you really want the national dialogue on the nature of God to be controlled by the Federal Government?  Do you have the faintest idea how detrimental that would be to the American Christian community? THINK!!!!!\n\nFor Schneb: random variation is only a PART of evolution.  Natural Selection is an entirely non-random process.  I'd wager a few thousand dollars that one could easily make a program that would randomly trigger pixels on the monitor, and select and retain pixels that had some resemblance of the WIndows logo, and in time, one would get a refined and accurate Windows logo.  Randomness in variation is only a part of the picture, and you ideologues have decided to cling to that part of the theory and ignore the rest--especially ignoring the vast amount of biochemical support for the theory, none of which could have been known to Darwin--in order to distort the case for the theory, which is very, very strong.\n\nDo you realize how long a billion years really is?  Life has been around for ~3.5 BILLION years.  Today you will pass 100 billion to 10 trillion E. coli into the toilet.  Think about the size of these numbers!  Think about the number of generations in the vast, vast oceans!  These sorts of statistically ""impossible"" things happne all the time.  Do you realize that the entire function of the neurons that let you read this depend on trillions of random moleculra collisions that eventually reach the right spot?  It's all random, Brownian motion that allows ions to diffuse in and out of the channels, that makes the gates open and close, that makes the synaptobrevin and synatotagmin and SNAP-25 proteins collide and fuse the cells membranes to spill the neurotransmitter into the cleft where it will randomly bump around the synapse and then randomly bind to a post-synaptic receptor, all before randomly bouncing around until it hits the reuptake proteins that will sequester the neurotransmitter.  I'm not making any of that up, and it happnes billions and billions of times just "

"5","what is an iPod?","","iPod is a brand of portable digital media player designed and marketed by Apple Computer. Devices in the iPod family provide a simple user interface designed around a central scroll wheel (with the exception of the iPod shuffle). Most iPod models store media on a built-in hard drive, while the smaller iPod shuffle and iPod nano use flash memory. Like most digital audio players, an iPod can serve as an external data storage device when connected to a computer. Discontinued versions of the iPod include two generations of the popular iPod mini and four generations of the full-sized iPod, all of which had monochrome screens except for the fourth-generation iPod with color screen (previously sold as iPod photo before it replaced the monochrome iPod in the top line). As of January 2006, the lineup consists of the fifth-generation iPod which can play videos, the iPod nano which has a color screen, and the iPod shuffle; all three iterations were released in 2005. The iPod is currently the world's best-selling digital audio player.\n\nThe bundled software used for uploading music, photos, and videos to the iPod is called iTunes. iTunes is a music jukebox application that stores a comprehensive library of the music on a user's computer, as well as being able to play and rip it from a CD.

Is that correct and what is the jumper setting. Thanks","Connect the data cable (IDE) exactly how the hard drive has been connected.  Usually, if you connect it the wrong way, it won't go into the drive at all.  If you are in doubt, refer to the manual that came with the drive or on the box.\n\nUsually, the jumpre has to be set to slave since the hard drive is the master.  If you have two IDE cables there are 4 options: Primary master and primary slave and Secondary master and secondary slave.  Your hard drive usually will be connected to  primary master.  So, depending upon your choice and any other connected drives set the appropriate option and jumper settings.  These settings are mentioned on the drive itself.  First verify the jumper settings of your hard drive."

"9","Making wedding album for gift, what should I do??","My best friend is getting married in late March. I am making her wedding Album for her gift. Here is the thing, should I drive ( 4 1/2 hours) to her house when she gets the pictures or would it be rude to ask her to send up the pictures???\n Any ideas???\nAnd great ideas on fun ways to make the alubm ( scrapbook)","Some things to think about:\n1)After the wedding is over, maybe you can coordinate a weekend or an overnight trip where you can take the drive, visit, get the pictures and share with her some of your ideas for a wedding album.  If you want the wedding album to be a total surprise, forfeit the first idea.\n2)If you do decide to take the first idea and you consider that today is January 20th, you realize that you still have alot of time to organize page layout, colors, find some stickers, stamps, markers, ribbons,  etc.  I realize that you will not know everything there is to know about the wedding yet since it hasn't happened, but every wedding clearly has a similar layout.\n\nSome ideas for the wedding album.  Try to get some random things from alot of people who were involved with or attended the wedding.  For example, you might get some pictures from alot of different people and decide which ones would be good for a nice storybook album.  You might want to do a brief page at the beginning of the album that gives a little bit of the couple's background...a picture of their houses as they were growing up, pictures with parents and siblings, senior year pictures, baby/toddler pictures, etc., a lock of hair if it is available.  Dedicate another section for dating-pictures at various events, silly pictures, engagement picture, etc.  Put some pre wedding pictures in there...the girls getting ready with applying makeup, getting hair done, pictures of bride and groom all dressed up with families, etc.  Put a copy of the wedding program in the album.  See if you can get some of the flower petals to put in various sections of the album.  Maybe put another page with ""Couples Favorites"" and include favorite song(s), hangout spots, dating activities, etc.  Last year, I went to a Creative Memories workshop and the consultant was really knowledgable regarding assisting with layout ideas, content ideas, etc.  I have also included the website link for Creative Memories http://www.creativememories.com/ so that you can take a look.  On the website, you will be able to find consultants in your area based on your zip code and there are ideas on how to set up albums.  I'm not suggesting that you order everything that Creative Memories has on their website, but there are alot of really helpful ideas to get you started as well as helpful ideas for making the album durable and long lasting.  Hope you have fun with the wedding and with scrapbooking!! :o)"

It might feel like you are paying a lot up front, but in the long run, you will save money.  To find out what you can afford take your rent and compare it to what you would pay for mortgage + taxes + repairs.  Now you have to look at the growth rate in your area and figure out how many years you are going to live there.  If you live there 10 years and the cost of your home doubles- then you made a lot of money, If the price is stagnant, then you lost money by paying taxes, paying for repairs and paying more $ than you would have rent.  The good news is you didn't have to ask anyone if your could paint the kitchen pink."

"2","Evolution and Human Blood Types.?","Thinking in evolutionary terms, why would differing blood types occur in humans? Death inducing diseases affecting specific blood types appear to be rare. Since blood types are not outwardly apparent, there seems to be no reproductive benefit of one type over the other.  If longevity and reproduction seem to be unaffected by blood type, then what could have been some of the causes that effected the evolution of human blood types over time?","Who told you there was no benefit?  A and B bloodtypes refer to the types of glycoproteins on the outsides of cells.  These gylocoproteins serve the function of acting as immunological recognition factors--they help the immune system differentiate ""self"" from ""non-self.""  Though the specific structure of such chemicals is largely arbitrary, it is not true to say that the existence of such glycoproteins is arbitrary.  As an analogy, there is no benefit to the *specific* combination of numbers that is in my social security number.  It's a random sequence, but a registry at the federal government allows the government to use that number to recognize my unique identity.  Hence the sequence of digits may be arbitrary, but the existence of the number is far from arbitrary.  I'd have a harder time getting through life in the US without one.\n\nLikewise, there may be not much evoultionary differences in today's society for the glycoproteins on a specific cell type, but if you had no such glycoproteins at all, you'd be unable to have a functioning immune system.  Evolutionary selective factors might not be so strong as to eliminate everyone with a particular cell left unlabeled by glycoproteins, but there is an evolutionarily important reason for having glycoproteins in general.\n\nMy blue eyes are such an anomaly comparable to the O blood type--the gene for making some modestly useful protein (likely more useful in the past than it is today) is not functional, hence a certain anamolous differnence exists between me and most people.  There is a slight advantage to having brown eyes, in that blue eyes are more sensitive to UV light (less important for my northern ancestors than for people from equatorial regions).  Likewise, it has been proposed (though not definitively concluded) that the A blood group had better chances of surviving the bubonic plague back in the times that it swept across Europe, leaving a greater prevalence of the A blood type in areas where the bubonic plague hit hardest."

"5","when i see open ports on my network, how do i establish a connection to them?","","It all really depends on what type of application has the port open.  For instance, if you are running a web server you would most likely see port 80 and perhaps 443 for a secure web site. If you had an FTP server running, you would see port 21 open.  To gain access to these various ports, it is best to use the application intended (ie. Web browser, FTP client, etc.) If you want to make a raw connection to an open port you can sometimes uses the telnet protocol and add the port number to the end.  Drop to DOS and type 'telnet <ip# of computer w/open port> <port#>' like this:  'telnet 127.0.0.1 25'  This would connect you to a SMPT server running on your local computer (port# 25)."

"3","What is the safest way to lose weight?","Diet and exercise or Diet pills and weight loss shakes?","If you are talking SHORT TERM, this two-week-long weight loss program will work. It has worked for me, for Renee Zellweger (after her Bridgett Jones movies) and for many others who need fast weight loss. Follow these steps religiously:\n\n1.Drink lots of fresh water every day using this formula: (your current weight) divided by 2 = ounces of water to consume each day. I like to drink room temperature water from a bottle because it’s easier to “chug.” I put four of the bottles on the kitchen counter and make sure they are all empty by the end of the day. Best to consume them throughout the day.\n\n2.Don’t drink any alcohol of caffeine. No soft drinks. Only green teas. REMEMBER, THIS IS ONLY 14 DAYS. YOU CAN DO IT IF YOU REALLY WANT YOUR GOAL.\n\n3.Fast walk or run for at least 60 minutes each day. It’s best to exercise in the morning since it will rev up your metabolism and keep our calorie-burn rate high throughout the day. You can do this by walking in place, using a treadmill, or walking outside. Whatever works for you.\n\n4.Do at least 50 crunches each day. I break mine into 2 or 3 different sessions. Also, if I need to do 20 crunches, I play a little trick with my mind and I “pretend” I am going to count to 25. It’s amazing how this helps the body get to all of the crunches with the same intensity.\n\n5.Eat only fresh vegetables! This is the key to the whole thing. Eat as many as you want, but DON’T eat any of the following: starchy vegetables including potatoes, squashes, pumpkins, and the like. They will work against you. Limit carrots, snow peas, and other veggies that are high in sugar content. NO GRAINS. Just fresh vegetables. You can eat salads, stir-fries, steamed, etc. But this is at the heart of your success.\n\n6.Don’t eat anything after 7:00 p.m.\n\n7.Put photographs (from magazines) up all over your house of trim, fit women. They will serve as motivators.\n\n8.Several times each day – especially when you first get up and when you go to bed, say something like: “I am enjoying my weight of (your goal weight).” Put it in the present tense and say it many times – with feeling! This will affect your subconscious mind to help you achieve your goal. Also, post these words in the same places where you post the photographs.\n\nAlso, don’t be surprised if you start feeling better than you have felt in a long time. You will have more energy, most aches and pains will be gone, and your whole body will look brighter. One warning, early on your elimination will be a little “urgent.” You may have some cramping. But this will all go away soon. Your body is in a deep cleanse."

"10","What is the difference between a Democracy and a Republic?","","A republic is a kind of democracy. Democracy is a wide-reaching term referring to basically any system of government in which the people play a significant part in the running of the government. A pure democracy is one in which every citizen votes on every decision, which is fairly impratical with the size of today's nations. A republic is a representative democracy, meaning people vote for people (president, representative, senator, etc.) to go represent them while actually running the country. This allows people to not spend all of their time voting on every bill, but still gives them control over how it is run, since most elected officials want to be reelected, and also avoid being recalled."

"7","what is general ledger?","","The general ledger, sometimes known as the nominal ledger, is the main accounting record of a business which uses double-entry bookkeeping. It will usually include accounts for such items as fixed assets, current assets and liabilities, profit and loss or income and expenditure items, and funds or reserves.\n\nThe general ledger is a summary of all of the transactions that occur in the company. It is taken directly from the general journal, where each transaction is recorded.\n\nThe balance sheet and the profit/loss statement are both derived from the general ledger. Because it is organized by accounts, the general ledger allows you to observe the impact of all the transactions affecting each account at any given time. The general ledger is where posting occurs, which is the process of recording credits and debits in the general ledger. The actual balances are called the trial balance.\n\nThe general ledger should include the date, description and balance entries for each account. It is usually divided into at least five main categories. These categories generally include assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses and sometimes additionally equity (liabilities held by the owners of the company). The main categories of the general ledger may be subdivided into subledgers to include details such as cash, accounts payable, accounts receivable, etc.\n\nBecause each transaction debits one account and credits another to an equal extent an accounting system will ensure that the general ledger will always be in balance unless, for example, an account (some times called a T-account) is deleted or mis-specified in the general journal."

"10","Whatt is Western Democracy??","I will appreciate if u can detail to me the so called\nWESTERN DEMOCRACY that Pres. Bush wants to SPREAD all\nover the Middle East in particular and the World at large>> thanks in  advance.","it's nothing more than a buzzword as far as what President Bush wants to do. They talk about democracy this and that, yet we cannot uphold our own. We didn't have a square election in 2000, nor did we have a choice in '04. The difference between the two candidates was nothing more than a coin toss. The real alternatives to them were pushed out by having more money and connections.\n\nAlso people get confused on what our country is. People automatically assume it's a democracy, when in fact it's a republic. Which is a limited democracy. Otherwise if we had a pure democracy, the majority woudl get whatever they want and the minority would be totally screwed. An analogy to that is two wolves tell a lamb whats for dinner. It doesn't and shouldn't work that way. We can barely even keep it a republic though.\nSo to ask what is western democracy, you have to see past what the talking heads preach and realize what is going on.\nYeah, we can elect people. yeah we can put in new laws..for ourselves, on our own account... Except when it gets hijacked by individuals who know how to manipulate it all. Then for the people to not have enough guts/critical thought to overturn the injustice...\nBut for us to force it on others is an antithesis of democracy in the first place.\nI don't recall the world calling a vote for candidate Mr. U.S. govt. and being nominated to decide what country should have a regime change first, especially when Mr. U.S. govt. supported that regime at one point.\n\nThe current aims of the U.S. govt. to coerce 'democracy' stands thus far:\n1) hypocritical, ours is failing\n2) illogical, forcing a democracy defeats itself\n3) moot, U.S. govt. could care less if people in other countries are actually free or not, it's about making the initiatives they create sound pleasant."
"2","Why there is no people from the future visit us?","I recall that there is some question around here that asks about time travel into the future. If THERE IS a time travel technology in the FUTURE, it's suppossed that people from the future will PAY A VISIT to us. Why we don't see them already in our age, if the time travel is possible?","Here is the famous astronomer late. Dr. Carl Sagan's answer to similar question. I found it in Nova website. Below is the paragraph extracted from that website.\n\n""First of all, it might be that you can build a time machine to go into the future, but not into the past, and we don't know about it because we haven't yet invented that time machine. Secondly, it might be that time travel into the past is possible, but they haven't gotten to our time yet, they're very far in the future and the further back in time you go, the more expensive it is. Thirdly, maybe backward time travel is possible, but only up to the moment that time travel is invented. We haven't invented it yet, so they can't come to us. They can come to as far back as whatever it would be, say A.D. 2300, but not further back in time. \nThen there's the possibility that they're here alright, but we don't see them. They have perfect invisibility cloaks or something. If they have such highly developed technology, then why not? Then there's the possibility that they're here and we do see them, but we call them something else—UFOs or ghosts or hobgoblins or fairies or something like that. Finally, there's the possibility that time travel is perfectly possible, but it requires a great advance in our technology, and human civilization will destroy itself before time travelers invent it."" -Carl Sagan"

Eat... or be eaten, Kill or be killed.\nFor those who have a life-trusting faith in God, it is sometimes harder to decide, since we are past those times when God tells his people to go and eliminate this group or that ""so that you may have the land that I have promised you.""\nIn current times we need to be loyal to our friends who call for aid.  We may sometimes need to step out and rescue a people from an unbelievably oppressive governmental hardship, particularly when that government gives all the signs that it not only materially supports terrorism but that it will conduct unprovoked war on other peaceful nations."

"2","Have American drugs companies gotten out of hand?","Are they controlling the way that medicine is practice?  Is every patient waiting for that super pill to make them healthy?","American medicine before the invention of Penicillin was mainly nutrition.  Working at a hospital I see medicine pushed by drug reps.  Some of these medicines are based on the idea of the sugar pill.  If you believe it will work it will.  Here is a classic senario for you that happens all the time at the hospital.  A elderly patient comes in with a cold or a cough.  Instead of doing cultures and finding what is the best drug for them they give a broad spectrum antibiotic such as rocephin.  This knocks out their normal flora of bacteria in their intestines giving room for C. Diff. to become the predominate bacteria.  This causes diahreah and the patient comes back for dehydration and feeling really sick because of this bacteria.  Vancomyacin is then prescribed to knock out C. Diff.  It does to an extent but then your normal flora of E. Coli end up mutating to Vanc Resistant Ecoli.  This is not a neccessarily a bad thing since it is not a problem while it stays in the intestines.  But by this time the antibiotics have caused yeast infections such as thrush and what not and you are very sick.  The doctor ends up having the patient cathiterized and they develope an Urinary Tract infection with the VRE.  They then develope Sepsis and end up dying.  The catch 22 is that if they had not been prescribed the Rocephin this would not have happened, but the drug companies have come up with a ""List"" of drugs that should be given to any patient presenting to the hospital with any symptoms of pneumonia, such as a cough.  It is called ""core measures"".  If they don't prescribe these medicines they are looked down upon by the hospital AND drug companies even though these can ultimately end up killing the patient."

Then, you would use your ""A"" string as a reference to tune the other strings. The strings on a violin are ""G"" ""D"" ""A"" and ""E"". Basically, the pitch of the strings is in ascending fifth. You want to try to tune to a perfect fifth: ie. ""G and D"" ""D and A"" and ""A and E"". \n\nWith a piano accompaniment, you tune to the A above the middle C on the piano. And use that as your reference."

"8","what year(s) were the most common bugle calls written?","I do civil war reenacting and want to play the correct bugle calls.","In the late part of the 18th century and early part of the 19th century attempts were made to make both the trumpet and bugle into chromatic instruments.  One such attempt was the slide trumpet.  Some historians attribute the invention to England.  A French version appears around 1840.  A description of the instrument follows:\n\n""It was basically the natural trumpet of its period except that the bend joining the middle pipe and the bellpipe was made in the form of a U-slide which could be pushed out towards the player by means of a rod with a touch-piece lying under the second and third fingers of the right hand and automatically closed again by a spring.""\nAnother early attempt was the keyed trumpet and keyed bugle. The keyed trumpet is about 40 centimeters long and is held in a horizontal plane. The best way to think of these instruments is as almost a hybrid of a saxophone and a natural trumpet.  There are a number of keys (between five and nine) placed around the instrument and the pitch is raised or lowered by opening any combination.  The tone is produced with a metal mouthpiece as with any other brass horn.  Both Franz Joseph Haydn (1732-1809) and Johann Nepomuk Hummel (1778-1837) wrote concertos for the keyed trumpet and their works were the hallmarks of the literature for the trumpet.  The invention of the keyed trumpet is attributed to Anton Weidinger of Vienna in 1801.  Weidinger was a court trumpeter who was employed as a military trumpeter and theater musician, for whom Haydn wrote his concerto.\nThe keyed bugle was essentially the same as the keyed trumpet but with the bugle's distinctive conical shape.  The keyed bugle was made originally in England and became known to the public through the works of Richard Willis (17?-1830), an arranger, composer and performer.  The first patent was made by Joseph Halliday (dates unknown) in 1811.  Halliday named his new instrument the Royal Kent bugle in honor of the Duke of Kent.  His patent called for five keys and the instrument made its way to the United States with Willis when he was appointed bandmaster of the United States Military Academy Band at West Point, New York.\nTwo performers on the keyed bugle worth mentioning are Francis Johnson (1792-1844) and Edward (Ned) Kendall (1808-1861).  Johnson was a talented black bandleader who played many instruments including the keyed bugle.  He also composed music for his band which played for parades, military drills, and balls in Philadelphia.  One of his compositions was The Bugle Quickstep, no doubt written with the instrument in mind.  The most important keyed bugle performer in the United States was Ned Kendall.  He started performing on the instrument around 1830, continuing the work begun by Willis.  Kendall perfected greater skill in playing and helped spread the popularity of the keyed bugle.  His solo skills were in high demand and he performed widely with a leading vocalist of the time, Miss Anna Stone.  Another performer on the keyed bugle was the bugler at West Point, Louis Benz, who was the post bugler for forty years from 1830-1870.  Photographs survive of Benz with keyed bugles.\n  \n \n Around the 1840s, while the keyed bugle was still popular, the development of valved brass instruments began to appear in the United States. This was the next step in making the trumpet and bugle chromatic instruments, and the development is highlighted in the story of the virtuoso instrumental piece called Wood Up Quickstep, composed in 1835 by John Holloway (dates unknown).  Many tales of the origin of the piece exist but according to Holloway it came to him while walking on the Common in Boston.  The piece became closely associated with Ned Kendall.  Despite the invention of the valved cornet, Kendall continued to play the keyed bugle all his life.  He took part in a famous contest with himself on the keyed bugle, playing against Patrick Gilmore on the valved cornet in December of 1856 in Salem, MA.  The cont"

"7","We could not pay for a mobile home we financed...what happens next with the finance co?","","You will get a series of nasty letters and phone calls from the financing company, and attorneys representing the finance company threatening to sue you, demanding that you pay up, etc.  All of these demand letters are spelled out in your financing documents or state lending laws before they can legally foreclose on your mobile home, so to some extent, they are just going through the motions and you should let them.  Given the current state of mobile home lending, they don't want your mobile home back.  They will soak you for every nickel that they can get from you.  Read your financing documents to see exactly what you are on the hook for - it might be much more than you think including repo costs, moving costs, legal costs, etc in addition to losing the mobile home.  It was nice of you to send the keys back to them, but that probably isn't the end of it by a long shot."

So far, the bird flu has only been passed from birds, either to other birds or in the isolated cases, to humans. However, if the flu mutates into a strain that can pass from human to human, people will have no immunity and the flu will probably pass rapidly from person to person, creating a pandemic. Flu vaccines can only be made to protect against a particular virus, and, since the virus has yet to be passed from human to human, no vaccine can be developed.\n\nIn Asia, many people live with ducks and chickens in their homes, and in their yards. Health and veterinary officials worldwide recently announced that a key way to stop the spread of the disease is to improve farming practices, segregating poultry from humans, and culling birds that have been infected with the deadly virus.\n\nWhat's next? When asked for predictions as to the seriousness of the pandemic, should one occur, experts have based their projections on a similar pandemic that occurred in 1918-1919. Up to a billion people fell ill, and nearly 100 million died worldwide. Translating to today's figures, they project that some 30-60 percent of the world's population could be infected by the virus, and over 300 million people worldwide could die. In the meantime, good hygiene remains the best prevention: keep hands well-washed, and avoid contact with people who have been infected with the virus."

"4","WHAT DOES Flesch - Kincaid Grade Level mean?","","The Flesch-Kincaid Readability Tests are readability tests designed to indicate how difficult a reading passage is to understand. There are two tests, the Flesch-Kincaid Reading Ease, and the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. Although they supposedly use the same measures, just placed into a different scale, the results of the two tests do not always correlate (a text with a better score on the Reading Ease test over another text may end up with a worse score on the Grade Level test.)\n\nFlesch-Kincaid Grade Level\nAn obvious use for readability tests is in the field of education. The ""Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Formula"" translates the 0-100 score to a U.S. grade level, making it easier for teachers, parents, librarians, and others to judge the readability level of various books and texts. \n\nThe result is a number that corresponds with a grade level. For example, a score of 6.1 would indicate that the text is understandable by an average student in 6th grade."

PHP classes or PHP functions?","I can take a reasonable guess not having looked at how it's implemented...\n\nOnce the object exists there will be almost no difference. Remember, a class is simply a collection of functions that have protected access to a group of variables. The only real drawback in OO languages is setting up this access for new objects, but these days it's hardly worth the mention. Inheritance, and the heirarchy lookup may, but it's extremely unlikely, make some slight difference.\n\nAt the end of the day, you need to store in variables what you need to store. Putting them in objects is simply more convenient in so many ways. You pay a tiny bit in performance for that, but you probably use less developer resources (if they count here)."

Google Talk, Skype, Gizmo.\n\nA cell phone with nationwide coverage the lowest minutes and unlimited night and weekend minutes works as well.\n\nType messaging (E-mails & IM's) through the internet.\n\n\nIf one of you has high-speed internet but the other does not you could use something like Skype. Which has an option to pay a few dollar per month (I think $3)and get a couple different virtual phone numbers in any area code you want. Get a number local to the person with-out High Speed internet.\n\nThat person calls the local number and it's forwarded to the computer with the internet connection for free.\n\nYou can also use Skype to Call-Out to any Normal Phone number in the US for about 2 pennies a minute.\n\nFission"

Its not very deep but its very very murky. You can barely see more than at arms lenght. Is there any diving technique for this type of situation? Are there special lights that would help?","In lieu of actually seeing the object, you might try this. \n\nGet a length of rope and tie it to an anchor. Hold onto the free end of the rope and drop the anchor near the center of the area you want to search. Holding the rope swim away from the anchor until the rope is pulls tight. Swim in a circle around the anchor, along the bottom, at the end of the rope. If the object is sticking up and hasn't settled in the silt, the rope will snag. At that point, you follow it back to your target. \n\nI know of at least one case where this method was used to retrieve a snowmobile that had gone through the ice on a frozen lake."

When a person doesn't think they're smart enough or good enough, they often end up expecting failure, and get what they expected.\n\nYou could start with education.  The grammar in your question suggests this may be a weak area.  Whether you're in school or not, there are resources you can go to.  If you're still in school, talk to a counselor about getting extra help.  Maybe you have a learning disorder that hasn't been diagnosed.  If you're out of school, the local district proabably has adult classes available.  Having an education helps most people feel better about themselves, and also helps them present themselves to others more effectively.\n\nKeep a journal.  That will help you examine your feelings and learn to express yourself, as well.  When you have a bad day, review what you might have done differently in the journal, and how you think it might have changed the outcome.  \n\nI also recommend counseling or therapy to help you understand and deal with your feelings of failure and where they come from.  And remember this: the only true failure is the failure to try.  Never give up!"

Identifying triggers, however, is not always simple. It usually involves a process of elimination. A good place to start is a consultation with your doctor. Ask for guidance. Your doctor may recommend a skin test for allergies.\n\nA vast range of triggers can set off symptoms of asthma. Chief culprits include dust mites, air conditioning (which cycles offending substances into the air we breathe) and cat dander. Individual asthmatics, however, tend to have their own ""red-alert"" triggers.\n\nCommon Allergic Asthma Triggers\nThe following is a partial list of common asthma triggers:\n\nalcohol \nair conditioning \nanimal saliva and urine \natmospheric ozone \nbetel-nuts \nbird, dog and cat dander \nchemicals (e.g., hexachlorophene, formalin, ethylene diamine) \ncockroaches \ncold air \ncolds and upper respiratory tract infections \ndrugs (especially aspirin, cimetidine, antibiotics, beta blockers) \ndust mites & their droppings \nemotional upset \nexertion (especially if strenuous and in cold air) \nfood additives or preservatives (e.g., tartrazine, sulfur dioxide) \nfungal spores \nfumes (e.g., paint) \ngastroesophageal reflux (GERD) \ngum acacia \nhair particle proteins \nhigh humidity \nkapok and feather fillers (e.g., in pillows and cushions) \nmetals (e.g., cobalt, platinum, nickel) \nnuts \nplastics \nPVC \nragweed pollen (particularly in the U.S.) \nrubber \nsawdust (especially oak, boxwood and cedar wood dust) \nshellfish \nsmoke pollution \nsolvents \nstress \nstrong odors \ntemperature/humidity changes \ntobacco \ntree and grass pollens. \n\n\nCommon cold:\nThe symptoms of a common cold include sneezing, runny nose, nasal obstruction, sore or scratchy throat, cough, hoarseness, and mild general symptoms like headache, feverishness, chilliness, and not feeling well in general.\nCold symptoms are due mainly to the body's response to the infection. When a nasal cell is infected by a cold virus, the body responds by activating parts of the immune system and some nervous system reflexes.\nColds last on average for one week. Mild colds may last only 2 or 3 days while severe colds may last for up to 2 weeks."

And also since I am not aware of any stage of evolution where a species has become a-sexual, two chickens must have been present.\nAnd that last note is important as chickens are far more advanced in current evolutionary theory than say single-cell amoebas, and are regarded to have begun well-after such a-sexual life dominated."

When saying that the devil ""did not stand fast in the truth"", Jesus indicated that at one time satan was ""in the truth"".(John8:44) But, as is true of all of God's intelligent creatures, this spirit son was endowed with free will. He abused his freedom of choice, allowed feelings of self-importance to develop in his heart, began to crave worship that belonged only to God, and so enticed Adam and Eve to listen to him rather than obey God. Thus by his course of action he made himself Satan, which means ""adversary"".--Jas.1:14,15"

The gravitational field is so strong that the escape velocity near it exceeds the speed of light. This implies that nothing, not even light, can escape its gravity, hence the word ""black."" The term ""black hole"" is widespread, even though it does not refer to a hole in the usual sense, but rather a region of space from which nothing can return. Theoretically, black holes can have any size, from microscopic to near the size of the observable universe.\nBlack holes are predicted by general relativity. According to classical general relativity, neither matter nor information can flow from the interior of a black hole to an outside observer. For example, one cannot bring out any of its mass, or receive a reflection back by shining a light source such as a flashlight, or retrieve any information about the material that has entered the black hole. Quantum mechanical effects may allow matter and energy to radiate from black holes; however, it is thought that the nature of the radiation does not depend on what has fallen into the black hole in the past.

"8","What's the big deal with The Strokes?","","I think the reason much is made of The Strokes is that they are an ""authentic"" rock and roll band.  When their first album came out in '99 - '00 the airwaves were saturated with the likes of boy and girl singers, who were just not rock and roll by any stretch.  I think the Strokes represented a true alternative to that.  Kind of like when Nirvana came and blew away the hair metal bands.  I think The Strokes did a similar thing (though by no means are they at Nirvana's level).\n\nAnyhow, I think they are stil taken seriously because their music is rock 'n' roll.  It's edgy.  And they are a really good live act.  Of course this is all my opinion.  But if you listen to their albums, you can judge for yourself."

If she knows your interested in her she will show it in some way or form. Do some nice things for her. After that, if she pays you no attention she probably just is not interested."
"2","What did John Paul Jones do in the American Revolution?","","During the American Revolution, John Paul Jones was an officer aboard the USS Alfred in 1776.  The USS Alfred was part of 6-vessel fleet that attacked English merchant vessels in New Providence.  Jones raised the first American flag over a U.S. Naval vessel aboard the Alfred.\n\nHis first command was the frigate USS Providence. Over a period of six weeks, his ship captured 16 enemy vessels along the coast of Nova Scotia.\n\nIn November of 1776, he proposed a mission plan to destroy the British coal fleet and free American prisoners held at Isle Royal.  He was assigned command of the USS Alfred and successfully completed this mission, including the capture of a British ship carrying winter clothing for British troops in Canada.  This is believed to have contributed to the success of the Continental Army at Trenton by providing them with fresh winter clothes.\n\nIn June of 1777, he was given command of the USS Ranger and was sent to France to help Benjamin Franklin and the American contingent there with strategic recommendations.  After France signed a treaty with America in 1778, the USS Ranger sailed for England and captured the British naval ship, HMS Drake.\n\nIn 1779, he assumed command of the USS Bonhomme Richard.  A five ship squadron, including the Bonhomme Richard, attacked a British merchant convoy off the coast of Yorkshire.  A pair of British vessels attacked the American squadron.  Two of the vessels fled while the Bonhomme Richard and two other naval ships attacked the British warships.  The HMS Serapis severely damaged the Bonhomme Richard, shooting off her flag during the attack.  The British commander, asked if Jones had struck his colors in surrender.  In response, Jones issued his famous quotation, ""I have not yet begun to fight.""  He then rammed his sinking ship into the Serapis, tied up to it, boarded and captured the ship."

When she was 13, she finally told my mom what was happening and mom said not to tell anybody, especially our dad (for fear of him killing the dude) but that was the worst thing she could've done.  My sister doesn't use it as an excuse for anything that has happened to her and she is one of the most awesome, most caring people I know.  She deserves some kind of justice.

Don't be afraid to go, and STOP taking Mom's advice (shame on her for making you girls keep quiet about it).

It cycles through after install. software etc. like it will print but flashes (bad printhead/replace cyan) and even with that will print nothing....The paper comes out with no ink. If anyone knows if this is worth adding the cyan prthd, I'll be glad to do that, but I was thinking that it should be printing the black ink at this point unless it needs cleaning, etc. Any solutions for cleaning, repair, salvaging this problem are deeply appreciated. THANKS!!","hello again.  thank you for choosing my previous answer as 'best answer'.  so sorry to hear you are still having problems.\n\ni, too would recommend replacing the cyan printhead.  it should run no more than $34.  Item number is HP c4921a.  Some printer units out there usually do not print ANYTHING if there carts/printheads are bad.  but they usually refuse to move at all.\nto replace the machine with the updated one would run you about $200.- $250.  so you need 2 decide if you want 2 put more in2 this 1, or scrap the idea and get a new 1.  i'd hate to see you be only $34 away from having the printer work flawlessly, and on the other hand, you don't want 2 nickle and dime you in2 the $200. price where you could have gotten a brand new one.\ndouble check with HP, i think they can be a great asset.  i think they also have a buy back program, where they will buy your old machine back.  they only give $50, but i'm not sure if this is limited to handheld units or not.\ngood luck - have fun!! - hope this helps."

You were with him for 11 years, it really doesn't matter if it was off and on it obviously had a meaning to it b/c you still love him after all of that time spent together. You need to sit back alone and figure out what both of them bring to the table. Think about everything that the guy you were with for 11 yrs. gave you. Remember nothin powers over understanding and happiness. If he doesn't make you happy inside & out and show you that he actually understands you regaurdless of the situation btwn you 2. Then maybe you were supposed to fall for the next guy, think about why you both were together for 11yrs. and you are just now thinking of marraige. Where there problems, issues, anything that stopped the both of you from growing. Only you know the answer to those questions. Just remember that your destined to be happy and explore a new and exciting life when you actually get married to someone. Make sure that whoever you choose deserves to share that happiness with you. Good Luck!!! I really hope that you get through this, but I think you will!!!\n\nEmail me at sweetfantasie85@yahoo.com (when you do make your decision)or just to talk EVERYONE needs a friend...... I'd love to know what happened anyway. Good Luck Again!!!!!!"

Also, the second link I give lists some really gruesome descriptions of what happens when you're exposed to nitrites (search for ""Summary of clinical effects"").  I don't know how soluble calcium nitrite is, but from what little chemistry I remember, calcium dissociates from compounds fairly easily.  So regardless of whether calcium nitrite would specifically kill you, it would probably dissociate into calcium and nitrite and the nitrite would kill you.\n\nMy mother (a biochemist) always says, ""The poison is in the dose.""  In other words, anything is poisonous to you if you consume it in large enough quantities-- even water!  (And no, I'm not talking about drowning.)"

If you don't know EXACTLY what that document says, you can still get shafted like you didn't have a contract in the first place. \n\nYou should do two things: 1) type a common sense letter that details how much was borrowed, the date the loan must be repaid, etc. and have the borrower sign and date it.  You keep the original. A copy can be given to the other guy.\n\nThen 2) DO NOT make the loan in cash. It should be a check. You should indicate that it's a loan on the memo line (something like ""Loan to Jack to be pd 8/1/06""), and you need to keep the cancelled check in a safe place.\n\nSince it sounds like you want the option of taking legal action, find out what the maximum amount is for small-claims court in the city/county where you live and where the other guy lives.  If small-claims court will only accept cases for $5,000 and under -- don't lend more than that.\n\nThat way if you have to go to court, you can do it on your own in small claims court instead of hiring a lawyer.\n\nAnd I think it goes without saying... but don't accept cash or personal checks as payment. Get it in money order or cashier's check."

I have never been convicted of a felony and I have only minor drug (meth) charges on my record. I am on the lowest level of probation until 2008 and I have not been arrested since 2003 on a F.T.A. warrant. Prior to that,I had no police contact since 2001.","Bless you for even asking.\n\nCan you do it?  Perhaps.  You have no felony convictions, so you are not automatically prohibited from a number of positions.  \n\nCrime scene analysis?  Probably not.  You're talking about working for a law enforcement agency, and I would think the chances of working for a agency while you're on probation are about slim and none.\n\nPreventing crimes against children?  Very possible, though probably not within the criminal justice arena.  Many private organizations do things like this, and you are uniquely qualified for a position in this field.  \n\nHuman trafficking?  Again, probably not within the criminal justice arena.\n\nWant to help out?  It's always possible.  Probably not as an employee, though...certainly not while on probation.\n\nWe can talk more, if you'd like...drop me a note at my user name at yahoo.com.  \n\nSeriously...bless you for wanting to do something.  I especially would like to see you get involved in preventing crimes against children, and you can certainly involve yourself in that field without having to work with or for a law enforcement agency.  \n\nWonderful drug that meth is, huh?  Sounds like it made a mess of your life...it would truly be wonderful if you can find a place in the world where you could help make things better.\n\nGood luck...write if you think I can offer more."

"2","Are there really beaches with black sand? Where are the beaches located and why is the sand black?","","Good question.\n\nPunalu'u Black Sand Beach is a beach near Naalehu, Hawaii on the Big Island of Hawaii that has black sand created by volcanic activity. The volcanic activity is now in Hawaii Volcanoes National Park. Taking black sand is prohibited, but local tradition says that if any of the black sand from Punalu'u beach is taken away from Hawaii that the person that took it will be cursed until it is returned. The same is said about the local volcanic rocks.\n\nHonokalani Black Sand Beach is located in the Wainapanapa State Park. This large beach is set among lava cliffs and the sand is actually small, smooth, lava pebbles. A small sea arch, sea caves, and seaside lava tubes are located in the beach area. King's Highway, an ancient Hawaiian footpath, leads from the beach area along the coastline for 3 miles to the town of Hana. \n\n\nPlease use the links below and check out the amazing information, \n\nI have attached \nlinks to encyclopedia references\nlinks to a pictures and description of a black sand beach,\nlinks to a pictures of the source of the black sand (lava)."

"5","what are the two types of scanners?","","Most scanners today are variations of the desktop (or flatbed) scanner. Hand-held scanners, where the device is moved by hand, were briefly popular but are now not used due to the difficulty of obtaining a high-quality image. Both these types of scanners use a charge-coupled device (CCD) as the image sensor, whereas a drum scanner uses a photomultiplier tube as the image sensor.\n\nOther types of scanners are planetary scanners, which take photographs of books and documents, and laser range scanners, for producing three-dimensional models of objects.\n\nDrum scanners:\n--------------\nDrum scanners, the oldest scanning technology, have a scanning photomultiplier tube, which moves back and forth along a single axis. The image to be scanned is soaked in oil, then wrapped around the drum; this process is known as dry mounting. The drum then rotates in front of the photomultiplier tube. The use of drum scanners has declined significantly as flatbed scanners based on charge-coupled devices have dropped in price; however, drum scanners are still used for certain high-end applications, such as museum-quality archiving of photographs, desktop publishing, and print production of books and magazines. They are very expensive. Only few companies manufacture them. Due to the fact that a photomultiplier tube is much more sensitive to light than a charge-coupled device and the scanning beam can be focused very narrowly, drum scanners can produce scans superior to those of flatbed scanners, both in resolution and in the gradations of color and brightness. Also, since drum scanners have the advantage for resolution, their use is generally recommended when a scanned image is going to be greatly enlarged."

"1","Are you ready to give you life up for the lord?","We Americans are so lucky that we live in a country that we are allow to worship and praise Christ and there are countries where if your were caught worshiping him you would be kill, if you don’t deny Christ you are killed. I’ve ask myself this question am I ready or willing to die for Christ? I’m learing how to live my life for the lord but will I give it up when need? Its so easy to say yes I will but when the time comes will I? To be honest I don’t know. I know there is life in him I know when I do die that I will be with him. But even with  that said im still scary of death. Why? I don’t know, all i can do now is pray that someday i will be ready right? Are you ready to give you life up for the lord","A couple years ago, I had a friend whom I hadn't seen in almost a year because he had developed a serious drug habit and I had a not quite one year old daughter to take care of, and was starting to get my own life together. One day I heard his name on the radio- he had been shot seven times in the back of his head and his body was found in a dumpster outside a recycling plant. I later found out from my daughter's father, who still saw my friend on a pretty regular basis, that two weeks before he was murdered, my friend had become a Christian. The reason he had been killed was because he was trying to get out of his old lifestyle and away from his old friends and start a new life following Christ. His former friends apparently thought he was really just trying to make an excuse to go and tell the police about them and their drug use, so they killed him. From the story I heard of what happened that night, the people who shot him had asked him to go somewhere with him, and he was scared to go because he knew they were up to something. But, despite the fact that he was afraid, I think he was ready to give up his life because he had accepted Jesus as his savior before he died. Chances are, although I can't say for sure, you will not be killed for your faith, but even if you are, you are already ready because of your faith."

Heat the ACV first and it will mix much easier with the honey perhaps in a half empty plastic honey bottle (leave air space until mixed).  Then take perhaps three teaspoons per day with apple cider (or any fruit juice).\n\nSugur and honey probably sweeten equally, but honey may have a plus."

Each state is very different on these requirements, particularly on how long you must work at a law firm, and some of those do require some classroom experience at an ABA accredited law school, even though they don't require a JD or LLD.\n\nThat being said, it is pretty rare for someone to apply for and be accepted to the bar without a law degree.

"1","What do you base your spiritual beliefs on If not one of the Holy books?","","It seems to me that, in the case of Christianity, you have to consider a couple of things:\n\nFirst, you base your spiritual belief on what YOU HEAR: ""So then faith cometh by hearing, and hearing by the word of God."" Rom 10:17)\n1 John 5:10 (King James Version)\nKing James Version (KJV)\n\nThen, if you have faith, you'll have the withness IN YOURSELF:\n""He that believeth on the Son of God hath the witness in himself: he that believeth not God hath made him a liar; because he believeth not the record that God gave of his Son."" (1 John 5:10). This refers to the Holy Ghost. As a matter of fact, the HOLY GHOST is our source of spiritual knowledge:\n""But the Comforter, which is the Holy Ghost, whom the Father will send in my name, he shall teach you all things, and bring all things to your remembrance, whatsoever I have said unto you."" (John 14:26)\n\nThe Bible is the repository of the Word of God. It is a coded book, you need the ""key"" of faith and the  understanding given by the Holy Ghost to be able to ""decode"" the message in it.\n\nIn my opinion, it is the Holy Ghost who gives you assurance that what the Bible says is true... So although externally we base our spiritual belief on what the Bible says, the Holy Ghost tells us that what is in the Bible is true.\n\nPlease remember that some translations could be wrong, I believe that only the original scriptures are without errors. The Holy Ghost can guide us through all this errors to the Truth (if we let Him to teach us, I mean if we listen to Him).\n\nIN SUMMARY, I do base my spiritual beliefs on the Bible, but with the aid of the Holy Ghost, who guides me and teachs me what is true and what is not true about what I read from the different existing translations of the Bible, AND from the different interpretations that people (e.g. pastors) may have  on what the Bible says."

"5","will a program that requires an Intel Pentium 4 chip run ok with an AMD Athlion chip?","","It all depends on what the program is, and its specific system requirements.\n\nCertain programs (like Word, Powerpoint) could care less about what type of processor it is, as long as the system is running WIndows.\n\nOther software, like ProTools, has very specific hardware requirements, and deviating from their favorites list will just cause you much drama.\n\nOther software can flip-flop either way. MS-Excel for example acts the same with both CPU's until you get into some super large numbers (2 to the 50th power or something like that) or extremely complex mathematical formulae (like what brokerage firms or actuaries might use). AMD processes mathematical calculations slightly different than Intel, and it will show up in complex calculations.\n\nSo, the moral of the story is to check the programs' system requirements."

Kinetic energy is calculated using the mass of the object and the SQUARE of the velocity, while momentum is calculated using the mass of the object and the velocity. \n   If the bullet and the gun were equal in weight they'd have the same energy AND the same momentum - and the shooter would have an injured hand."

"4","how do i get into archeology?","","If you want to study it in college, begin looking at those that offer the program.  Then contact someone in the department to find out more specific information about the program such as requirements for graduating, what projects they are working on, how involved they are in the community, and who the professors are.  Make sure you that you keep in mind what YOUR interests are.  For example, don't choose a university that focuses on southwestern archaeology if you would rather study underwater archaeology.\n\nOnce you find a program you like and are accepted, get involoved in the depratment.  Get to know the professors and staff members. This will give you more opportunities for field experience or internships.  You will go alot further in the field if you know people than if you only attend class.  In archaeology, its who you know that really takes you places. It doesn't take long for us to realize who is really going to make it in the field.\n\nIf you are purely just interested in it, there are many books out there on the subject, some excellent and some fiction.  Make sure you choose something that was written by a archaeologist working at the academic level or a respected agency.  If you don't you may end up with something about divination.  Also, Archaeology Magazine is an excellent source about what going on in the field right now.  You may also be interested in joining the AIA (Archaeology Institute of America).  It has chapters all over the country which usually hold field trips and monthly lectures.\n\nWhat you do not want to do is play Indiana Jones and just start digging things up on your own.  Through education you will be taught the proper techniques and guidelines for excavation so the data you collect will be useful.  As soon as you dig something up, you will lose its context and any information it can give about the past.  Proper education will teach you how to save this information.\n\nSo, when it comes to Archaeology stay up to date, stay involved, and always be willing to learn something new!  \n\nIts an amazing field to be involved in and very rewarding!"

It's just common courtesy to say ""thank you"" when somebody, male or female, holds a door open for you, rather than let it slam into your face.\n\nI hold doors open for ANYONE who's a few steps behind me, whether they are male or female.  Guys almost always say thanks, and women (particularly white ones) rarely do.\n\nSo what's the story?  Please don't tell me that by saying thank you, it's an invitation to unwanted sexual advances, because that has to be the lamest copout for general rudeness and discourtesy on the planet.  \n\nAnd if you tell me that it's chauvinistic to hold a door open for a women, how can you explain the fact that guys hold doors open for each other all the time?","Well, I am a white woman, and I always say ""thank you"" when someone holds the door open for me.\n\nThe reason some do not is that they have no manners, plain and simple."

"4","How can I get a scholarships?","","Fastweb is a good resouce. Also you have to fill out the FAFSA (free application for federal student aid) this is what the government (state and federal) and the schools themselves use to determine scholarship eligibility. Also, go to your college financial aid office, they have a lot of resources about scholarships for a given field of study or for a given religion or a given community. You have to go there to find out. Also, my high school had a scholarship for people who's parents went to the high school too (multi-generational attendance).

Polar molecules can create favorable interations (hydrogen bonds) where + and - charges match up, for an energetically favorable configuration.  Lipids (fats and oils) are non-polar, and do not forma favorable interactions with water and other polar solvents.  Hence, they keep to their own--polar and polar go well together, and nonpolar goes with nonpolar.  Hence, hydrophobic (water fearing) and lipophilic (fat loving) mean the same thing."

"7","Attaching a mobile home to owned property - any advantages/disadvantages?","I know someone who owns a double or triple-wide mobile home and the property it's sitting on.  She also purchased an adjacent lot.  I'm not familiar with all the terminology involved, but I'm trying to find out if there are any advantages/disadvantages to making a property ""permanent"" on the land.\n\nThis process involves setting a foundation of some sort and having it reevaluated (by an appraiser I assume.)  From there you go to the city and have it reclassified as a home vs. mobile home.\n\nThe one advantage I can think of is banks would be willing to lend home equity at better rates, treating it as a home vs. a mobile home.  Many banks won't give out home equity loans to mobile home owners, even if paid off.  Are there other advantages?\n\nThe disadvantage.  Higher taxes?  Would property taxes change somehow with this reclassification?  Would it help or hurt in any way (i.e. taxes) for her to combine the property and both lots into one large lot?","The process you are describing is called 'title elimination' or something similar.  In my state, mobile and manufactured homes are licensed just like trailers and cars, by the vehicle licensing department.  By eliminating the title, you are tying the ownership with the land which give lenders a much better lien.  Many lenders won't lend on mobile homes if the title has not been eliminated.  It can also be retitled later if needed.\n\nIt shouldn't have any affect on the value, but may help in obtaining better financing since the market has completely collapsed for mobile home lending."

Persons with AS show marked deficiencies in social skills, have difficulties with transitions or changes and prefer sameness. They often have obsessive routines and may be preoccupied with a particular subject of interest. They have a great deal of difficulty reading nonverbal cues (body language) and very often the individual with AS has difficulty determining proper body space. Often overly sensitive to sounds, tastes, smells, and sights, the person with AS may prefer soft clothing, certain foods, and be bothered by sounds or lights no one else seems to hear or see. It's important to remember that the person with AS perceives the world very differently. Therefore, many behaviors that seem odd or unusual are due to those neurological differences and not the result of intentional rudeness or bad behavior, and most certainly not the result of ""improper parenting"".\n\nBy definition, those with AS have a normal IQ and many individuals (although not all), exhibit exceptional skill or talent in a specific area. Because of their high degree of functionality and their naiveté, those with AS are often viewed as eccentric or odd and can easily become victims of teasing and bullying. While language development seems, on the surface, normal, individuals with AS often have deficits in pragmatics and prosody. Vocabularies may be extraordinarily rich and some children sound like ""little professors."" However, persons with AS can be extremely literal and have difficulty using language in a social context. \n\nAs for the ""left brained, right brained"" theory, that is a myth that came about when some reporters watered down research on 'split brain' procedures (where you cut the corpus collosum in order to prevent severe seizures)."

"4","Can you demonstrate that Newton's third law ?","Can you demonstrate that Newton's third law is true by taking some examples from real life. Then, explain how Newton's third law applies in those situations.","Cool, you have asked what is totally QUESTION NUMBER ONE in basic physics. It's an exciting question which many teachers secretly don't understand and so their students get this hazy idea and kind of go thru the motions. Here's a way to remember and understand through a kooky made-up story.\n\nWow, it is so basic, that it took a super-genius, I mean way smarter than Einstein, to figure it out. A good old farm boy, astrologer, magician & alchemist, religious fanatic, mathematician and all around kook. Yep. Sir Isaac Newton. You gotta wonder what kind of parents would name their kid ""Sir""\n\nWell we all know what a force is, it is a sort of push or pull -- think of it as something that changes or *tries to change* the motion of stuff.\n\nNewton first figured out that if you leave a thing alone, or if the pushes and pulls on it cancel out, then it will sit there like a lump. Like those drivers wearing hats, and like sit there after the light has already turned green two minutes ago.\n\nOr else a thing will keep moving in the same straight line direction and speed like those drivers wearing hats who go 40 mph on the expressway with their turn signal blinking on and on. This is known as ""THE HAT LAW"".\n\nAll was well until he noticed that things move faster in an amount equal to how much you bully them or push them around. Twice the force, twice the fasterness and fasterness (also known as acceleration). This is called the ""YOU BIG BULLY LAW"".\n\nThen he discovered a fly in the ointment. His HAT and BULLY laws didn't really explain all that much. Something was gumming up this beautiful theory. We call it MASS and it is still an unknown mystery as to what it really is. So we vaguely call it the amount of stuff or matter in a thing.\n\nSo he found out that for a certain force the faster-isity (acceleration) is cut in half if you double the mass. The bully has to push twice as hard to fasterize two little kids. So he was like ""I'll just add that in, and all will be cool"". The ""YOU BIG BULLY LAW"" and ""THE HAT LAW"" totally did it all. Wa ta da babee!\n\nBut then Newton had a road accident. He was gunning his Harley over London bridge at like 250 when a bug hit him in the mouth and knocked out one of his wooden teeth. He was all ""Why am I so in pain?"". And the bug as it squooshed said ""Help! I'm a bug!""\n\nSo spitting out the splinters of his wooden tooth and the splattered bug, he had this revelation. He realized that because he was moving so fast, and the bug slowed down so fast, that even a eentsy mass like a bug was like taking a hammer to his tooth.\n\nHe noticed that the force was equal to the mass of the bug times the speed of impact all happening in a brief moment. Since Newton spoke Latin (he was the love child of Joe Newton and an Italian governess) he wrote ""Fastus buggus ina momentum hurtus like crazy."" Today we call this ""momentum"". It is just ""mass times speed"" or ""force times a small moment of time"".\n\nAnd he realized that the bug smashed up his tooth, but also that the bug was squashed (like a bug) because they were trading the EXACT same amount of momentum. The force on the tooth by the bug in the moment of time was PRECISELY equal to the smacko-ing the tooth used to stop the bug dead.\n\nHe said ""Hey, like he broke my tooth, but I killed him soooo dead!"" He did the math and found that the force of the bug on the tooth was equal to the force of the tooth on the bug!\n\nNo way did the two equal forces cancel, after all, his tooth was hammered to splinters, and the bug was flattened. They were equal and opposite, but since one was on the tooth, and the other force was on the bug they did serious damage! Today we call this the ""HELP I'M A BUG"" law.\n\nNow our man 'Zack was all set. He wrote down his three laws:\n\nTHE HAT LAW (beeep! beeep! Move it Hat G"

If the airline is pressurized, there's no effect (usually cargo planes are pressurized, except in extreme cases).  Physics dictates that the bubble would ""appear"" to EXPAND in the increasing altitude due to lower pressure outside/inside the plane; therefore if you are concerned about shipping something via altitude w/o pressurized cabin--- no worries.  It would take a trip outside of earth's atmosphere to pop... if no cabin pressurization.  Don't take it out scuba diving; water depth increases pressure exponentially, and would collapse them."

I don't think the refs were doing favortism, they did spot the ball horribly in Iowa's favor twice off by a yard or more. But they did hurt Iowa bad on 5 horrible calls.

"2","what's capacitor?","","Capacitor, device for storing an electrical charge, sometimes called a condenser. In its simplest form a capacitor consists of two metal plates separated by a non-conducting layer called the dielectric. The dielectric may be air, plastic, waxed paper, or another substance such as the mineral mica. When one plate of a capacitor is charged using a battery or other source of direct current, the other plate becomes charged with the opposite sign; that is, positive if the original charge is negative, and negative if the original charge is positive\nThe electrical size of a capacitor is its capacitance, that is the amount of electric charge it can hold per unit potential difference across its plates—C = Q/V. The SI unit of capacitance is the farad (F). Because this is such a large unit, capacitors commonly have their size expressed in µF (1 microfarad = 10-6 F) or pF (1 picofarad = 10-9 F)."

I know the function converges to 0 as n approaches infinity, and I am interested in how fast.\n\nSpecifically: f(n)= the nth sin of 1 (or x)\n\ne.g. f(5) = sin(sin(sin(sin(sin(1)))))","This is not a complete analysis, and I am not an expert in this area, and just the result of a few random thoughts. You can flesh this out as needed. \n\n\nLet f(n,x)=the nth application of function g to x. In your case g(x)=sin(x). In general, a function g(x) will have some values x at which f(n,x) converges to a fixed point, and some values x at which it does not, but diverges, or exhibits periodic or chaotic behavior (wanders around in some bounded region). \n\nFor the case of g(x)=sin(x), \n\nf(1e1,1)=.463\nf(1e2,1)=.1689\nf(1e3,1)=.0546\nf(1e4,1)=.0173\nf(1e5,1)=.0055\nf(1e6,1)=.0017\n\nPlotting log(f(1en,1)) versus n shows an approximately straight line, so that if a0=-1.1274 and a1=0.4303, then y(n)=a0*n+a1 is a reasonable approximation for log(f(1en,1)), and log(f(1en,1))-y(n) is \n\n(-0.0729, 0.0460, 0.0441, 0.0222, 0.0036, -0.0431) \n\nfor n=1,2,3,4,5,6 respectively. \n\nI notice that there appears to be some oscillatory behavior in this residual, which you might be able to model fairly accurately as well for more variance reduction in your convergence prediction. \n\nMaybe this will get you started and you can dig into this further, depending on how much depth you need."

For the former, it is a largely homogenous product, whereas for the latter, it refers generically to wares offered for exchange.\n\nLinguistically, the word commodity came into use in English in the 15th century, being derived from the French word ""commodité"" meaning ""benefit, profit"", similar in meaning to biens (goods). The Latin root meaning is commoditas, referring variously to the appropriate measure of something; a fitting state, time or condition; a good quality; efficaciousness or propriety; and advantage, or benefit.

There have been several research studies that concluded that some antibiotics do indeed decrease the effectiveness of the pill. Hence, it becomes more likely that an unintended pregnancy could occur. \nThe general recommendation when taking antibiotics for a short amount of time is to use an additional backup contraceptive method such as a latex condom during the treatment time and for one week afterward. When taking antibiotics for a long period of time, the general recommendation is to use an additional backup method for the first two weeks of the antibiotic use. \nIt also is important to remember that you should continue using the pill unless directed otherwise by your health care provider.

He was born in England in 1837 and arrived in Australia in 1866. His immediate movements are unknown, however, in 1868 he surfaced in northern New South Wales in company with a Queensland bushranger named Charles Rutherford. They bailed up a party of travellers near Walgett, stealing some money and a revolver. However, the travellers were able to give a good description of the men to the police and soon a Queensland Police trooper named McManus, a New South Wales trooper named McCabe and a blacktracker were on their track.\n----------\nMention the name Harry Redford in Longreach and you're sure to be greeted with tales from local residents that have been handed down from their parents and grandparents.\n\nDuring the last 117 years, the man has become something of a local legend.\n\nAlthough writers have, to date, written about Harry Redford, recent evidence presented by Patrick McCarthy in his book 'The Man who was Starlight',has proven that Redford's name was in fact Henry Readford. But whether he be Redford or Readford, to local residents he has come to be more popularly known as 'Captain Starlight' - a ficticious name drawn from Rolfe Boldrewood's Australian classic 'Robbery Under Arms'."

Many doctors, including surgeons majored in a field other than science such as business, philosophy, etc.  Having said that, the MCAT, which is a test required by virtually all U.S. medical schools, contains questions on both physical sciences as well as life sciences.  In addition, most medical schools require a list of basic coursework in sciences.  So while you do not need to MAJOR in a science, you will need to take a number of science courses.  \n\nFinally, your major in your undergraduate program will have no impact on what happens after medical school.  If you want to be a surgeon, you need to do well in Mmdical School and of course there are different areas of surgery that are more difficult to get into than others.\n\nSo worry about getting into medical school first: Good MCAT score, high GPA (3.5 or higher), and of course your unique and diverse persona."

"4","Can you name the different types of amphibians?","","Traditionally the amphibians are taken to include all tetrapods that are not amniotes. Recent amphibians all belong to a single subgroup of these, called the Lissamphibia. Recently there has been a tendency to restrict the class Amphibia to the Lissamphibia, i.e. to exclude tetrapods that are not more closely related to modern forms than they are to modern reptiles, birds, and mammals.\n\nThere are two ancient, extinct, subclasses:\n\nSubclass Labyrinthodontia (paraphyletic) \nSubclass Lepospondyli \nOf the remaining modern subclass Lissamphibia there are three orders:\n\nOrder Anura (frogs and toads) (in Superorder Salientia): 5,228 species \nOrder Caudata or Urodela (salamanders): 552 species \nOrder Gymnophiona or Apoda (caecilians): 171 species \nAuthorities disagree on whether Salientia is a Superorder that includes the order Anura, or whether Anura is a sub-order of the order Salientia. In effect Salientia includes all the Anura plus a single Triassic proto-frog species, Triadobatrachus massinoti. Practical considerations seem to favour using the former arrangement now."
"7","how do i start a web site?","","If you're just wanting to start up your own small, personal website that isn't going to cost you anything, and you don't mind a little bit of advertising and restriction in what you can do, check out places like http://www.geocities.com/ to signup for your own free webspace, with an address like http://www.geocities.com/yourusername/. These services are free and a good place to start with web building, as they offer simple tools, wizards and WYSIWYG (What You See Is What You Get) options to help you get you started.\n\nIf you're looking to get something more advanced done, check out services like http://www.lunarpages.com/ who offer quite cheap, but stable web hosting and domain registration packages that will set you up quite nicely on the internet. You'll need some software to design your site (whether that be a WYSIWYG editor like Dreamweaver, Frontpage or so on, or a text editor like Notepad) and a little bit of cash to pay for the package and the domain name (the cheapest Lunarpages package is around US$7.95 per month with a domain name included)."

"4","when was hoola hoop invented?","","Fascinating facts about the invention of the Hula Hoop by \nRichard P. Knerr and Arthur K. Melin in 1958. HULA-HOOP® \n \n  \nYou may think that the Hula Hoop was a fad born in the 1950s, but in fact people were doing much the same thing with circular hoops made from grape vines and stiff grasses all over the ancient world. More than three thousand years ago, children in Egypt played with large hoops of dried grapevines.  The toy was propelled along the ground with a stick or swung around at the waist.\nDuring the fourteenth century, a ""hooping"" craze swept England, and was as popular among adults as kids.   The records of doctors at the time attribute numerous dislocated backs and heart attacks to ""hooping.""  The word hula became associated with the toy in the early 1800s when British sailors visited the Hawaiian Islands and noted the similarity between ""hooping"" and hula dancing.  In 1957, an Australian company began making wood rings for sale in retail stores. \n\nThe item attracted the attention of Wham-0, a fledgling California toy manufacturer. Richard P. Knerr and Arthur K. Melin, of Wham-O, manufactured a plastic hoop in a variety of bright colors.  Knerr and Melin promoted it for months in 1958 on Southern California playgrounds where they would do demonstrations and give away hoops to get the children to learn and play. Their perseverence turned HULA HOOP into the greatest fad the country has ever seen. Twenty-five million were sold in four months! \nThe Hula Hoop was introduced in 1958 and made the two men very rich indeed.   \n\nThe fad died out in the sixties, but Hula Hoops are now very much with us again thanks to the fitness craze.  What better way to grind off those unsightly bulges around the waist and hips.\n \nAT A GLANCE:\nIn 1957, an Australian company began making wood rings for sale in retail stores. The item attracted the attention of Wham-0, a fledgling California toy manufacturer. The next year Richard P. Knerr and Arthur K. Melin, of Wham-O, manufactured a plastic hoop in a variety of bright colors.  \nInvention: Hula-Hoop / noun / brand name / Tradeamark WHAM-O Inc \nFunction: A trademark used for a light plastic hoop that is whirled around the body for play or exercise by the movement of the hips. \nPatent: Wham-O could not patent an ancient item \nInventor: Richard P. Knerr and Arthur K. Melin  \n  \nMilestones:\nBC\n1000 Egypt children played with large hoops of dried grapevines.\nAD\n1948 Wham-O was born in a garage when they began producing slingshots that sold for 75 cents.\n1957 an Australian company began making wood rings for sale in retail stores. \n1958 Wham-O, manufactured a plastic hoop in a variety of bright colors. \nhula-hoop, Richard P.

Are the Scriptures lying or are the people from the Church misguiding us or are those priests taking everything literally from the Scriptures rather than going into deeper meaning. What do you think???","I think that the problem a lot of people have with Christianity is that a large segment of Christians try to translate the Bible literally.  This only leads to kind of a joking atmosphere when discussing certain aspects of Christianity and makes it very hard to take the good parts as, well, good parts.  Since some of these people, who believe so completely that the literal translations are the correction translations, feel compelled to constantly, repeatedly and forcefully enlighten others as to their beliefs, it burns bridges for everyone who falls under the banner of Christianity.  Consequently, those who see the teachings of the Bible as simple lessons of morals are not able to spread that understanding because most listeners have become cynical whenever they are preached at.  It is a shame that all that people hear and see is the inherent holes yelled at them by sidewalk prophets and not the plain belief that the Bible is a list of good ideas set to a classic storied theme.  So, just try to take the Bible as a good story with some ideas and morals to try to live by.

"2","does oil replace its self as fast as it is taken?is it hollow space?","","If your question is about how fast oil will come out of the ground, it varies. There are a very few oil reservoirs in the world where the oil is actually in hollow space, previously caverns, and these can be pumped out as fast as the pumps can go. Most oil comes out of the ground quite slowly, sometimes a well may only pump a few barrels a day. The most prolific wells can produce several thousand barrels a day. However, to get the most oil from the well, the daily production is often limited because allowing it to come out quickly will damage the reservoir and often result in only producing water from the well after a short period. \n\nIf your question is about how oil is created and how long it takes, the answer is millions of years. The real answer is related to how long it takes for the organic material in rock to reach a certain pressure and temperature by burial under other rock. An example is the Lower Miocene age rock near South Padre Island. The oil generation took place between 135 degrees Celsius and 175 degrees Celsius at depths between 3,600 meters and 4,600 meters, while natural gas was generated between 155 degrees to over 200 degrees Celsius and at depths of burial ranging from 4,000 meters to 5,000 meters and greater. This burial process is caused by rivers like the Mississippi River depositing sediment on river deltas. This is what takes millions of years."

"5","what is a dataware??","","data warehouse\nA database designed to support decision making in an organization. Data from the production databases are copied to the data warehouse so that queries can be performed without disturbing the performance or the stability of the production systems.\n\nData Marts\nData warehouses can become enormous with hundreds of gigabytes of transactions. As a result, subsets, known as ""data marts,"" are often created for just one department or product line.\n\nUpdated at the End of a Period\nData warehouses are generally batch updated at the end of the day, week or some period. Its contents are typically historical and static and may also contain numerous summaries.\n\nOperational Data Stores\nThe data warehouse is structured to support a variety of analyses, including elaborate queries on large amounts of data that can require extensive searching. When databases are set up for queries on daily transactions, they are often called ""operational data stores"" rather than data warehouses (see ODS). See OLAP, DSS, EIS and BI software."

"2","How does electromagnetic resonance stimulating EMRs works ?","","Electromagnetic resonance stimulation (eMRS) speeds up the breakdown of lactate, the rapid removal of lactic acid.\nThis means the typical pain disappears more quickly.\n\neMRalso accelerates cell regenration by stimulating metabolism, so that training intervals can be shortened in top-class sport.\nPromotion of circulaton counteracts wear on the joints.\nThe warm-up program stimulates the cell metabolism so that the cells are prepared for performance. Pulled muscles and tendons can thus be avoided"
"7","are mortgage brokers better than banks?","","Mortgage bankers tend to use funds from their own credit lines to get you into a mortgage.  Then they sell you to a big company (Countrywide, Homeside, etc) and repay their credit line with those funds and lend to the next person, etc etc.\n\nMortgage brokers take your loan to whomever has the best rates and lowest pricing (or, at least the good ones do).  In theory, your mortgage broker is supposed to shop around FOR you, getting you the best deal.\n\nBut you *must* do your due diligence as a consumer and shop for rates.  Just because someone is friendly and seems honest doesn't mean the next company might not have a lower rate or lower fees.  Get all quotes and estimates in writing, make sure the company making the quote is willing to lock you *SAME DAY* (rates change from day-to-day, and in as little as hour-to-hour).  Make sure you are given a good faith estimate of fees.  Alot of shady brokers/bankers/internet companys say ""No points!"" but then charge an origination FEE equal to a point+.  (See?  It's a ""fee"" not a ""point""!)\n\n**Do not let prospective agents pull your credit until you have decided who you will do business with!**\nCredit inquiries will diminish your credit score.  You might end up inquiring yourself right out of a good mortgage rate if you have too many recent inquires!\n\nOnce you have those lists of fees and rates, the decision is fairly simple who to do business with.  There are more than enough people out there doing mortgage loans that one company doesn't need to get fat on any one loan.  \n\nGood luck and happy hunting!"

"10","When paying child support, is payment suspended while the child is with the non-custodial parent? If not why?","","A child support order is based on a number of factors, including the income and expenses of both parents and the percentage of time each parent has custody or visitation.  The amount of time that each parent spends with the child is already figured into the amount of support paid.  Therefore, payments will generally not be suspended during times when the child is with the non-custodial parent.\n\nSuppose for example, the non-custodial parent has the child 10% of the time.  That person will pay higher support than a non-custodial parent who has custody 40% of the time because there is a presumption that support will be provided during the time of custody.  The bigger the custodial burden, the biggest the monetary support will be."

Just keep in mind...what's your expertise? What are your interests? What could you imagine yourself doing?\n\nThen, once you have some ideas, research, research, research. Check out the competition -- their business practices, pricing, customer service, etc. And also think about what you could offer to set yourself apart from these other companies.\n\nCheck the sources for some handy sites.\n\nPrior to investing your time, money & effort into a business name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available. \n\nThis entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. \n\nResearch is needed to make sure your trade name is legally available, before opening, before expansion, before incorporation or before designing your logo. Similarities in sound, appearance and meaning affect you too!\n\nThere are 16+ million trade names in use in the United States. Similar names matter, if close in sound, appearance or meaning. Similar names in related classes, distribution channels and customer matter too. You are affected by Common Law use (14 million), State Trademarks (500,000) and Federal Trademarks (2 million)."
"3","What is VUCG a medical examination.?","","A voiding cystourethrogram is an x-ray image of the bladder and urethra during urination.\n\nThis test is performed to detect abnormalities of the bladder and the urethra. The test may also detect abnormal bladder emptying or any congenital abnormality. In males, it may detect urethral stricture and the extent of narrowing in the prostatic urethra.\n\nX-rays are a form of electromagnetic radiation like light, but of higher energy, so they penetrate the body to form an image on film. Structures that are dense (such as bone) will appear white, air will be black, and other structures will be shades of gray\n\nUsually, the urinary bladder does not show up well on conventional x-rays. In this examination, a contrast medium is introduced into the bladder to improve visualization.\n\nX-ray images are taken in various positions with the bladder full of contrast and while the bladder is being emptied."

I don't know why he asked such a silly question.\nSome people here have a feeling that they are real know-alls and there are others who are just too serious about life. The know-alls must understand that it was by mere chance that they were able to experience or read or learn about a certain fact while others were not so fortunate. For the other types, it will be too late, when they understand that life is to be enjoyed even when you are on your death-bed provided you have the right attitude."
"2","Why can't we use water as fuel (H2O)? Hydrogen and Oxygen? Both very flammable and abundant.?","","There is one major problem. Electrolyzing the two elements (separating the H2 from O) requires more energy to separate it than it releases.  There is no cost effective way to break the bonds, currently.  The only plus about H2 for Fuel Cell cares is that it lasts longer than batteries (H2 does not die out), 1 L of compressed H2 takes you as far as 1 L of petrol, and it is clean burning.\n\nHowever, the only energy abundant enough to separate the bonds comes from coal, oil, and natural gas.  And since the 1st law of thermodynamics is correct we will be using more energy to make H2 to power our cars than we will at our homes."

"5","What is the actual work of a Oracle DBA and SUN Administrator?","","An Oracle Database Administrator holds a key role in keeping the system up and running and hence, whatever business it supports up and running. It is a very technical role. They are typically the ones who move objects (tables, views, triggers, functions...) from one environment to the next (Development-->test-->production). They work closely with developers who write software to read/write/update/delete data to and from the database.  They monitor database size allocations and make adjustments for growth. they determine proper data elements that should be used for indexes so that searches against the database run quickly for customers. There is much more. It is a demanding job and they are often the first ones who are required to 'get the system back up and running' when the database goes nutty. (like when someone accidently submits a wacked out query doing a full table scan.\na SUN administrator is different than a DBA because they do not focus on the database but they keep the server hardware running that the database runs on. They monitor server performance and deploy other custom written unix or java applications that programmers have developed. they too get involved with 'getting the system back up' when something goes haywire. It is also a very technical role and requires great knowledge of the unix commands and operating system."

"4","who discaverd computer?","","That depends on how you define the word ""computer.""\n\nA succession of steadily more powerful and flexible computing devices were constructed in the 1930s and 1940s, gradually adding the key features of modern computers, such as the use of digital electronics (invented by Claude Shannon in 1937) and more flexible programmability. Defining one point along this road as ""the first computer"" is exceedingly difficult. Notable achievements include the Atanasoff-Berry Computer, a special-purpose machine that used valve-driven (vacuum tube) computation, binary numbers, and regenerative memory; the secret British Colossus computer (1944), which had limited programmability but demonstrated that a device using thousands of valves could be made reliable and reprogrammed electronically; the American ENIAC (1946) — which was one of the first general purpose machine, but still used the decimal system and incorporated an inflexible architecture that meant reprogramming it essentially required it to be rewired and Konrad Zuse's Z machines, with the electromechanical Z3 (1941) being the first working machine featuring automatic binary arithmetic and feasible programability."

The careful observer will, however, note three seasons:\n\n    * Cool: From November to the end of February, it doesn't rain much and temperatures are at their lowest, although you will barely notice the difference in the south and will only need to pack a sweater if hiking in the northern mountains, where temperatures can fall as low as 5°C. This is the most popular time to visit and, especially around Christmas and New Year's, finding flights and accommodation can be expensive and difficult. \n\n    * Hot: From March to June, Thailand swelters in temperatures as high as 40°C. Quite nice when sitting on the beach with a coconut in hand, but not the best time of year to go temple-tramping in Bangkok. \n\n    * Rainy: From July to October, although it only really gets underway in September, tropical monsoons hit most of the country. This doesn't mean it rains non-stop, but when it does it pours and flooding is not uncommon. \n\nNote that there are local deviations to these general patterns. In particular, the south-east coast of Thailand (including Ko Samui) has the rains reversed, with the peak season being May-October and the rainy off season in November-February. \n\nDecide :D and rate me best answer"

"4","Where did the phrase ""ok"" come from?","","The history of the abbreviation OK is not what you'd expect. Some think that it comes from the Chocktaw affirmative okeh, or the Greek olla kalla, or others. The truth is that in the 1830's in New England, initialisms were the fad. Much like TGIF and FYI in modern times, in fact. The craze even went into generating letter combinations of intentional misspellings. Popular ones were ""K.G."" for ""know go"", ""K.Y."" for ""know use"", and ""O.W."" for ""oll write"". ""O.K."" naturally followed, standing for ""oll korrect"". O.K. is the only one that survived through the years. It's because of Martin Van Buren, elected our eighth president in 1836. He was born in Kinderhook, New York. Early in his political career, he was nicknamed ""Old Kinderhook"", which echoed the Oll Korrect initialism. OK became the rallying cry of the Old Kinderhook Club, a political organization supporting Van Buren during the 1840 campaign. The initials stuck as what H. L. Mencken described as ""the most shining and sucessful Americanism ever invented""."

"10","Who is CARDINAL MAZARIN?","","Jules Mazarin, born Giulio Raimondo Mazzarino (July 14, 1602, Pescina, Italy – March 9, 1661, Vincennes, France) served as the chief minister of France from 1642, until his death. Mazarin succeeded his mentor, Cardinal Richelieu.\n\nBiography\nMazarin's early military and diplomatic experience, which marked him as a friend of France in the contests between French and Spanish factions in papal politics, recommended him to Richelieu. As papal vice-legate at Avignon (1632), and nuncio extraordinary in France (1634), Mazarin was perceived as an extension of Richelieu's policy, and under Habsburg pressure, Mazarin was dismissed by Urban VIII, January 17, 1636. Mazarin immediately went to Paris, offered his services to Richelieu and was naturalized as a French citizen by April. The apex of his diplomatic services was the secret treaty between France and Tomasso of Savoy signed late in 1640. The following year, at Richelieu's insistence, Mazarin made cardinal.\n\nAs Louis XIII died in 1643, and Louis XIV was only a child — Mazarin functioned essentially as the ruler of France: although the 5-year-old Louis XIV became king in 1643, under the regency of queen mother Anne of Austria, and until his death in 1661, Mazarin directed French policy. His modest manner contrasted with the imperious Richelieu, and Anne was so fond of him and so intimate in her manner with him, that long-standing rumors that they had been secretly married and that the Dauphin was their offspring.\n\nA fictionalized Mazarin is a major character in Alexandre Dumas' novel, Twenty Years After. In it, Mazarin is portrayed as power-hungry, paranoid, and greedy.\n\n[edit]\nMazarin's policies for France\nMazarin continued Richelieu's anti-Habsburg policy and laid the foundation for Louis XIV's expansionism. The victories of Condé and Turenne brought the French party to the bargaining table at the conclusion of the Thirty Years War with the Treaty of Munster and Treaty of Osnabrück (Treaty of Westphalia), in which Mazarin's policies were French rather than Catholic and brought Alsace (though not Strasbourg) to France; he settled Protestant princes in secularized bishoprics and abbacies in reward for their political opposition to Austria. In 1658 he formed the League of the Rhine, which was designed to check the House of Austria in central Germany. In 1659 he made peace with Habsburg Spain in the Peace of the Pyrenees, which added to French territory Roussillon and Cerdagne in the far south and part of the Low Countries.\n\nTowards Protestantism at home, Mazarin pursued a policy of promises and calculated delay to defuse the armed insurrection of the Ardèche (1653) for example, and keep the Huguenots disarmed: for six years they believed themselves to be on the eve of recovering the protections of the Edict of Nantes: in the end they obtained nothing.\n\nTowards the pontificate of the successful Spanish candidate, Cardinal Pamphili, elected pope (15 September, 1644) as Innocent X, there was constant friction. Mazarin protected the Barberini cardinals, nephews of the late pope, and the Bull against them was voted by the Parliament of Paris ""null and abusive""; France made a show of preparing to take Avignon by force, and Innocent backed down. Mazarin was more consistently an enemy of Jansenism, more for its political implications than out of theology, and on his deathbed warned young Louis ""not to tolerate the Jansenist sect, not even their name.""\n\nControversy over the Cardinal's policies, and the weakness of the regency, resulted in two civil wars, known as la Fronde (1648-52). Twice, in 1651 and 1652, he was driven out of the country, by the Parliamentary Fronde and the Fronde of the Nobles. The countless abusive and satirical pamphlets called Mazarinades published against him often invoked his Italian birth. In addition, the increasing authoritarian royal power of France (a process begun under Richelieu), as"

"2","Why does a boomerrang come back to you?","","A returning boomerang is a propeller. Though it is not a requirement that the boomerang be in its traditional shape, it is usually flat. A falling boomerang starts spinning and most then fall in a spiral. When the boomerang is thrown with high spin, the wings produce lift. Larger boomerangs are used in hunting, thus they drop on the ground after striking the target. Smaller ones are use in sport, and are the only boomerangs that return to the thrower. No one would think a spinning object flies a straight line, neither does the boomerang, it flies a turn or to be clearly: It flies on a circle. So it naturally returns to its starting point unless all spin is eaten up. Now in more detail:\n\nReturning boomerangs consist of two or more arms or wings, connected at an angle. Each wing is shaped as an airfoil, air travels faster over one surface of an airfoil than the other, as it follows the longer path, thus creating lift, along what is roughly a plane which intersects the airfoil at a near right angle along the long axis of the wing.\n\nThese wings are set so that the lift created by each wing opposes the lift of the other, but at an angle such that the flight pattern is constantly shifted as the forces of lift, drag, speed, rotational inertia etc. 'attempt' to reach equilibrium, see Boomerang engineer.\n\nThis is what makes the boomerang 'return gracefully to the hurler, fluttering to a stop in his hand'... when thrown correctly. This is also what makes the boomerang 'rocket straight up into the air before plunging to its shattered doom'... when thrown incorrectly. With the exception of long-distance boomerangs, they should not be thrown sidearm or like a frisbee, but rather almost vertically.\n\nFast Catch boomerangs usually have three symmetrical wings (in the planform view), whereas a Long Distance boomerang is most often shaped very similar to a question mark. Maximum Time Aloft boomerangs have one wing considerably longer than the other. This feature, along with carefully executed bends and twists in the wings, help to set up an 'auto-rotation' effect to maximize the boomerang's hover-time in descending from its highest point in the flight.\n\nProminent boomerang designer/builders include Bob Burwell and Tony Butz from Australia, Rusty Harding from the USA, Jerri Leu from Brazil and others.\n\nFollow the link for more information.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boomerang#Design"

Talk to him. If he is reluctant to answer you, then you need to tell him that. Explain what is bothering you so that it doesn't seem that you are getting upset over nothing. You have a reason to question what is going on becauseof the fact that he has slept with her in the past. He would be suspicious too if the roles were switched. If he keeps getting defensive even when you are open about your worries then you need to put your foot down because he shouldn't be keeping things like this a secret from you... Bottom line... he wouldn't be defensive if there was nothing to hide."
"10","If a fire truck was on its way to a fire and it passes another fire, which fire would it go to?","","Unless the fire truck is told otherwise, it should go to the fire that it was originally sent to.  The dispatcher will have a much better picture of what resources are available to fight both fires and they should make the decisions on which truck to send to which fire.\n\nLike with any emergency service, the situation can change from minute to minute.  The fire truck should radio the dispatcher and inform them of the new fire.  The dispatcher might already have another fire truck on the way or they might redirect the truck to the recently observed fire.\n\nYou also have to consider the type of fire involved.  A fire at a hospital full of patients will have higher priority than a fire an an empty warehouse.  Each case is different."
"6","which team will be the best in the nfl in 2006?","give reasons why.","In the AFC it will come down to the Steelers or Colts. The Colts are fantastic, but the Steelers are as well. Aside from the loss to the Colts and the Patriots by three, the Steelers lost three games due to injuries. Those three games Jaguars, Ravens and Bengals all came down to the final minutes or overtime and all were by 6 points or less and in two of those games Maddox gave up six turnovers. Now they are all healthy and running on momentum. The Colts I'm sure will be ready, but I don't know if they will be flat or not for essentially not playing for a couple of weeks. With Jerome Bettis considering retirement and the superbowl in his hometown I think the Steelers have extra motivation. The defense is playing very well right now too. During the game with the Colts the Steelers lost 26-7, and they should have. But Big Ben's knees were still iffy and he broke his thumb halfway though the game. The Steelers did not run the ball 35 times, only 20 some. When they run the ball 35 times or more they are somehting on the order of 102-2. The Steelers had a chance to score 10 as they missed a field goal and the Colts scored 3 at the very end so there is the possibility that the game could have been 23-10. The Colts got a touchdown very early in the game in which the d-back did not stay with his responsibility. So say that mistake could have made the game 15-10. Aside from another touchdown the Colts scored three field goals. I think both teams are very even and it will be a very close game, something the Steelers have seen but the colts have not."

Sex is not just a game, and it is not just a physical thing, there is so much more depth to sex. Sex is 90 percent emotion, 10 percent physical driven. Once you have found the one who you love and cherish, and want to spend the rest of your life with.. you will feel more ""mind blowing"" physical reactions.

After it is healed, the screw is uncovered.  A dentist then bonds a ""tooth"" on the screw.  Once it is complete, the implant functions and looks like a normal tooth.  You can eat and floss like normal.  Most patients say the implant does not hurt being placed."

If they are not supporting the hamas noe it means they are the violators of their own principles and their people should take serious view of the hypocracy of their states themselves, otherwise they should not claim to be so called the civilized nations.","I like your question and your answer.  You NAILED it.  Bush got caught with his foot in his mouth.  His attempt to spread democracy in the middle east his way backfired on him.  Yep, instead of congratulating hamas on their elected victory, something he's not too familiar with, he wants them to renounce terrorism and put down their weapons, or take away their foreign aid money.  Now that I think about it, would Bush even be in office if we had fair elections?"

It still won't be foolproof.  \n\nYou can set up spam filters in most email accounts.  But the spammers are working hard to get around those too."

I have never really forgiven myself for what I did. I worry that a situation will occur that I can't deal with and will leave again. So I wonder if I can trust myself or if others can trust me. This one act has affected me for thirty years. I should have gotten counseling a long time ago, so I could forgive myself and move on. You sound really hurt by what you did, so you did not screw up because you don't care about other people. People can do really bad things, see the light, and learn better ways of taking care of themselves and others. You can't change the past, so get help, find ways to forgive yourself, seek, if you can, the forgiveness of the people you hurt, and try not to be so stupid, selfish, or out of control (whatever fits) in the future. The only thing you need to give up is your identification of yourself as a bad person. Practice trying to think about what you are doing and whether it's the right thing. My way of deciding ethical questions is simple: what would the world be like if everybody did what (ever) I am contemplating doing? If it is not a place I would want to be, I don't do it. Please find help (if you don't have money, try county mental health). See a priest or rabbi, talk to your mom or a favorite relative, see a doctor - do something. If what you did is related to drugs or alcohol, you may be able to get help through AA. Talk to someone so you can get perspective of what happened. You don't have to be afraid, it doesn't have to haunt you or ruin your future. Seek another path. Peace."

"6","Name some extreme sports & how fine is the line between a normal sport & an extreme sport?","","Some exameples are: skateboarding, inline skating, snowboarding, or one of the more extremer sports, such as Moto X, skysurfing and kytesurfing.\n\nExtreme sport (practically synonymous with the term action sport) is a general term for sports featuring speed, height, danger or spectacular stunts. A feature of such activities in the view of some is their alleged capacity to induce a so-called ‘‘adrenaline rush’’ in participants (a misnomer, since often the rush or high obtained is a product of increased levels of dopamine endorphins and serotonin).\n\nExtreme sports are often associated with young adults wishing to push themselves to the limits of their physical ability and fear, in turn pushing the boundaries of a particular sport. This youthful demographic accounts too for extreme sports’ frequent association with youth culture, not restricted to clothing fashions and music.\n\nSome contend that the distinction between an extreme sport and a conventional one is as much to do with marketing as it is to do with perceptions about levels of danger involved or the amount of adrenaline generated. Snowboarding thus has a more extreme ‘‘image’’ than skiing due to differing marketing strategies and the fact of being a newer sport, even though skiing is a faster and at least equally dangerous activity."

I know what means, but how did they come up with that term.","","Uncle Tom's Cabin is a novel by American abolitionist author Harriet Beecher Stowe which treats slavery as a central theme. The work was first published on March 20, 1852. The story focuses on the tale of Uncle Tom, a long-suffering African American slave, the central character around whose life the other characters—both fellow slaves and white slave owners—revolve. The novel dramatizes the harsh reality of slavery while also showing that Christian love and faith can overcome even something as evil as enslavement of fellow human beings.\n\nUncle Tom's Cabin was the best-selling novel of the 19th century (and the second best-selling book of the century after the Bible)[1] and is credited with both helping to start the American Civil War and helping to fuel the abolitionist cause in the United States.\n\nDespite these positive effects, the book also helped create and spread common stereotypes about African Americans, many of which endure to this day. Among the stereotypes in the book include the affectionate, dark-skinned mammy; the pickanniny stereotype of black children; and the Uncle Tom, or dutiful, long-suffering servant faithful to his white master or mistress. In recent years, these negative associations with Uncle Tom's Cabin have to a large degree overshadowed the historical impact of the book."

Well, don't wait--ask him out! If you're shy and don't know how to make this happen, follow these easy steps. \n\n\n\n\nSteps \nMake sure to hang out in places where you know you will see the guy you have a crush on. This could be at the mall, the movies, or maybe at the baseball field if he's an athlete. \nWhen you have the opportunity, talk to him or his friends and find out if he has a girlfriend. \nCommence flirting. This can mean a lot of things, like catching his eye with a glance, touching him lightly on the arm, or laughing at his jokes. Sometimes, you can flirt from afar and entice him to come over to you. \nAsk him what kind of things he likes to do, such as what he likes to eat, if he likes to play sports, or if he's a movie lover. Once you find something you both have in common, ask if he'd like to do it together sometime. \nIf he says no, or seems like he needs more time, don't get too upset; always say you can just be friends if that's what he wants. Chances are, he'll change his mind. Guys do this a lot. \nIf he says yes, then plan where and when you will go out, and don't forget to have fun. \n\n\n\nTips \nOn the day you plan to ask the guy out, make sure to wear an outfit that gives you confidence. This will make you much more comfortable and give you the courage to make your move. \nTry not to be too nervous...guys love being asked out, since they're the ones usually doing all the work in these situations. \nWarnings \nSome girls try to get guys to ask them out by making them jealous or playing hard to get. This can backfire because the guy could give up, or get annoyed by your tactics. The best approach is to be honest and straightforward about your feelings. \nEven if you have asked a guy out, it does not mean you are obligated to do anything you don't want to on the date. If you ever feel uncomfortable, get out of the situation right away."
"3","what is cancer?","","Cancer is a class of diseases characterized by uncontrolled division of cells and the ability of these cells to invade other tissues, either by direct growth into adjacent tissue (invasion) or by implantation into distant sites (metastasis). This unregulated growth is caused by damage to DNA, resulting in mutations to genes that control cell division. Several mutations may be required to transform a normal cell into a malignant cell. These mutations are often caused by chemicals or physical agents called carcinogens. Some mutations occur spontaneously, or they can be inherited (germ line mutations.)\n\nCancer can cause many different symptoms, depending on the site and character of the malignancy and whether there is metastasis. Cancer may be painless. A definitive diagnosis usually requires the histologic examination of tissue by a pathologist. This tissue is obtained by biopsy or surgery. Once diagnosed, cancer is usually treated with surgery, chemotherapy, or radiation.\n\nIf untreated, cancers may eventually cause death. Cancer is mainly a disease of later years, and is one of the leading causes of death in developed countries. Most cancers can be treated and many cured, especially if treatment begins early. Many forms of cancer are associated with exposure to environmental factors, such as tobacco smoking, alcohol, and certain viruses. Some of these can be avoidable, and public health and vaccination programmes are important on a global scale."

"4","What are some names of famous scientists that dealt with lasers?","","In 1916, Albert Einstein laid the foundation for the invention of the laser and its predecessor, the maser, in a ground-breaking rederivation of Max Planck's law of radiation based on the concepts of spontaneous and induced emission. The theory was forgotten until after World War II.\n\nIn 1953, Charles H. Townes and graduate students James P. Gordon and Herbert J. Zeiger produced the first maser, a device operating on similar principles to the laser, but producing microwave rather than optical radiation. Townes' maser was incapable of continuous output. Nikolay Basov and Aleksandr Prokhorov of the Soviet Union worked independently on the quantum oscillator and solved the problem of continuous output systems by using more than two energy levels. These systems could release stimulated emission without falling to the ground state, thus maintaining a population inversion. Townes, Basov and Prokhorov shared the Nobel Prize in Physics in 1964 ""for fundamental work in the field of quantum electronics, which has led to the construction of oscillators and amplifiers based on the maser-laser principle.""\n\nIn 1957 Charles Townes and Arthur Leonard Schawlow, then at Bell Labs, began a serious study of the infrared maser. As ideas were developed, infrared frequencies were abandoned with focus on visible light instead. The concept was originally known as an ""optical maser"". Bell Labs filed a patent application for their proposed optical maser a year later. Schawlow and Townes sent a manuscript of their theoretical calculations to Physical Review, which published their paper that year (Volume 112, Issue 6).\n\nSimultanously, Gordon Gould, a graduate student at Columbia University, was working on a doctoral thesis on the energy levels of excited thallium. Gould and Townes met and had conversations on the general subject of radiation emission. After that meeting, Gould made notes about his ideas for a ""laser"" in November 1957. In 1958, Prokhorov proposed an open resonator which became an important ingredient of future lasers. The first introduction of the term ""laser"" to the public was in Gould's 1959 paper ""The LASER, Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation"".\n\nFollow the link for more information.

"10","Do Liberals really hate America?","or is this a convenient way to rally the ignorant masses into simplifying an issue?","Her's the LONG ANSWER. Don't read on if you have a limited attention span...\n\nMost Liberals don't hate America. Some do no doubt. What I think is that when some consevative talking head comes on the tube and says Liberals are baaaaad!!!!, many people swallow it. There are many impressionable people in this country who are DAMN mad and want to quench the bloodlust generated by the 9/11 attack. Capitalizing on this wave of patriotic zeal the hard core neo-cons (which are not the same as average Republicans) manipulated the entire post attack national conversation. They saw this national tragedy as a way to implement a broad and radical shift in U.S. foreign policy. The Neo-Cons were able to do this because nobody, Republican or Democrat had the balls to stand up to this radiacalism in the shadow of 9/11. The small govornment, fiscaly responsible Republicans have watched in disbelief as our budgetary spending has gone where no tax and spend Liberal ever dared take it. Inflating the budget wouldn't be so bad if it went to sensible programs for security and to update ifrastructure.But instead it is being used as thank you money in the form of ""pork barrel "" spending around the country, into the districts of those congressman and senators who vote in favor of the Neo-Con agenda.\n The term Liberal is batted around so much it's funny. What the traditional notion is referring to is a tax and spend agenda. Giving poor and underprivelaged people breaks and assistance in a multitude of areas, thus taking money from the people who earn money. These Liberals are actually really angry with the current administration for the way it uses tax breaks for the wealthy. Then using the budgetary process gives more money to the wealthy via the industrial war production inflated by the war on terror. Then it gives  no-bid contracts to companies such as KBR (Haliburten) and others connected to the Neo-Con teat.\nWhat you have is a giant spending machine where the profits keep returning to the same people. This notion has yet to sink in with most republicans. They are still too enraged by 9/11 to open their eyes to what is happening. They are being manipulated to cast out the Liberals with all of their uppity talk of Constitutional law and limited Executive power. Those aren't sexy ideas to think about and for this reason most of the ranting conservatives simply roll their eyes and shake their heads,and proclaim ""We should pitty those poor deluded Liberals"".\nWell one day (or not) the rest of the country will wake up and join the Liberals. The old fasion Reagan Conservatives will wake up the quickest. They'll wonder why G.W. hasn't seen fit to put an end to the orgy of spending. Why would we mortgage our future so a handful of companys can prosper in the near-term? That doesn't seem like conservativism. The very reason for anti-Liberal angst (out of controll spending) is the lifeblood of the current administration. Only this time the poor don't see the benefits. It is the mega-corporations getting our tax dollars without the oversight of the Congressional Budget Oversight Commitee.\nIt all boils down to this: Aside from their left wing social views, Liberals are actually doing the work of the minority in any democracy. They are trying to balance the impulse of the current leadership to gorge on as much money and power as they can before their time is up.\nThe rhetoric is so amusing. Those stupid Liberals. When will they ever learn? It seems our job as citizens isn't to think for ouselves but is to regurgitate the meaningless and empty words of our righteous benefactors the Neo-Conservative puppet masters. All of you Liberals and Conservatives should be thinking for youselves. It is a pity there are so many uneducated people in this country who speak so loudly. They try to convince the masses that it is better not to be ""smart"". ""You don't want to be like those elitist "

"2","Why is the sky dark at night?","","This is a classic question that puzzled people for centuries, known as Obler's Paradox. If there are so many stars in the sky, why is the night sky not lit up from all the stars? \n\nThere are several interesting aspects to this question: \n\n1. First, distant stars are receding from us at increasing speeds (Hubble's Law). The speed of these distant stars causes their light to be Doppler-shifted out of the visible range, so our eyes cannot see the light from these stars any more.\n\n2. The universe is full of dark matter, which does not shine, and probably absorbs light, so a lot of light gets absorbed this way. \n\n3. If a distant star is receding at close to the speed of light, its light might not ever reach us, or might take a very long time to reach us, so the light has not got here yet from some stars. \n\n4. There are black holes in the universe, that are objects so dense that photons are drawn in by the immense gravitational forces, and cannot escape. These also reduce the amount of light that we can receive. \n\n5. There are vast empty areas of space, so there are not an infinite number of stars available to produce light to brighten our nighttime sky. \n\nThere are probably some other considerations as well, but this at least gives you a starting point when considering this very interesting question."

We need to pick and choose what is right (since, well, Christians already do), and homosexuality has been shown to be innate (and shown also in other species) rather than a choice. SO a better question may be: Why would God make homosexuals? Just to send them to Hell? I think not."
"7","Does putting my real image in yahoo answers assists in receiving more serious answers?","","Well, it makes you real. I think we all want people on here to realize we are ""real."" I find that some people on here will just dash off anything feeling that the person on the other side is just a font without feelings. You remind us that there is a face to match the words. Questions like this are also serious enough to make us stop and think. That helps a great deal as well. We all need to approach every question realizing that no matter how odd it is, someone with a heart wrote it. We have to use tact......we have to treat all just like we would if we were all socializing at a party and discussing issues together. Yes, the avatars are 'cutsy' instead of true depictions of us. But its provided for all the various reasons we need to use them. I appreciate your candid nature, your openess and your recognition that people do treat it a bit differently. Thank you for making us think with this question."

Something must not be right in her life (ie. no father figure in the picture) because she sounds desperate for a ""man's"" acceptance. Sit her down and tell her how you feel.

"1","what is  the origin of life?","","Research into the origin of life is a limited field of research despite its profound impact on biology and human understanding of the natural world. Progress in this field is generally slow and sporadic, though it still draws the attention of many due to the gravity of the question being investigated. A few facts give insight into the conditions in which life may have emerged, but the mechanisms by which non-life became life are still elusive.\n\nFor the observed evolution of life on earth, see the timeline of life.\n\nResearch into the origin of life is the modern incarnation of the ancient concept of abiogenesis. Abiogenesis, in its most general sense, is the generation of life from non-living matter. The term is primarily used in the context of biology and the origin of life. Abiogenesis was long considered to be a very common occurrence until the Law of Biogenesis (omne vivum ex ovo or ""all life from an egg"") became firmly established in modern biology as a result of the work of Louis Pasteur.\n\nCharles Darwin in a letter to J.D. Hooker of February 1st 1871, made the suggestion that life may have begun in a ""warm little pond, with all sorts of ammonia and phosphoric salts, lights, heat, electricity, etc. present, that a protein compound was chemically formed ready to undergo still more complex changes, at the present day such matter would be instantly devoured or absorbed, which would not have been the case before living creatures were formed."" Thus, it is the presence of life itself, operating in an oxygen rich atmosphere, itself a product of life, which prevents ""spontaneous generation"" from occurring on Earth today.\n\nThis modern definition of abiogenesis is concerned with the formation of the simplest forms of life from primordial chemicals, in an environment regarded as similar to that at the time shortly after the formation of the Earth. This is significantly different from the concept of Aristotelian abiogenesis, which postulated the formation of complex organisms. This article reviews different hypotheses for modern abiogenetic processes that are currently under debate.\n\nThere is no truly ""standard"" model of the origin of life, however most currently accepted models build in one way or another upon a number of discoveries concerning the origin of molecular and cellular components for life, which are listed in a rough order of postulated emergence:\n\nPlausible pre-biotic conditions result in the creation of certain basic small molecules (monomers) of life, such as amino acids. This was demonstrated in the Urey-Miller experiment by Stanley L. Miller and Harold C. Urey in 1953. \nPhospholipids (of an appropriate length) can spontaneously form lipid bilayers, one of the two basic components of a cell membrane. \nThe polymerization of nucleotides into random RNA molecules might have resulted in self-replicating ribozymes (RNA world hypothesis). \nSelection pressures for catalytic efficiency and diversity result in ribozymes which catalyse peptidyl transfer (hence formation of small proteins), since oligopeptides complex with RNA to form better catalysts. Thus the first ribosome is born, and protein synthesis becomes more prevalent. \nProteins outcompete ribozymes in catalytic ability, and therefore become the dominant biopolymer. Nucleic acids are restricted to predominantly genomic use. \nThe origin (see Origin of organic molecules) of the basic biomolecules, while not settled, is less controversial than the significance and order of steps 2 and 3. The basic inorganic chemicals from which life was formed are methane (CH4), ammonia (NH3), water (H2O), hydrogen sulfide (H2S), carbon dioxide (CO2), and phosphate (PO43-). As of 2004, no one has yet synthesized a ""protocell"" using basic components which has the necessary properties of life (the so-called ""bottom-up-approach""). Without such a proof-of-principle, explanations have tended to be short on specifics"

"1","Why does Jesus have to come 2 times to get everything done?","The Messiah was to bring peace on earth. Thre isn't any. He will do this on his second visit here.\n\nWhere in the Old Testament, not the New Testament, does it predict that the Messiah will make two trips to get everything done?  The Messiah may be described as having a dual role- redemption from sin, and a physical kingdom on earth, but where does it say he has to do this in 2 trips here?","My question to you is where does it say that he does NOT do it in two trips. God sent his Son as a gift of salvation but if some don't accept this gift then why should they expect to reap the benefits of His gift. The Messiah is not coming back to ""Fix what he did wrong the first time"". The Messiah is coming back the second time to take all of us that have accepted his glorious gift back with him to spend eternity in Glory. And just so that you know, for those of us that have accepted this awesome gift, we do have peace. It is those that do not want to accept it that can't experience the peace that he brought the first time, but it is never too late to accept His gift and begin living with the peace and happiness that so many of us have! You're in my prayers."

Fwiw , the thought of church, attending church and those who choose to force the gosple down my throat bores me. Yet why am I such a hypocrite when it comes to thoughts of suicide?","I not only cotemplated, I tried suicide.  Trust me, it's a real eye opener.

"2","What are the structural differences between phospholipids and triglycerides?","This is a Cell and Molecular biology class.  I need as much detail as possible please.  Thank you.","Trigylcerides are composed of two types of molecules: glycerol and 3 fatty acids.\n\nPhospholipids are similar to triglycerides in that they contain glycerol and fatty acids, too. But, the big difference is that phospholipids are made up of 1 glycerol molecule and only 2 fatty acid molecules (not 3!)\n\nThis is a big difference because in place of the third fatty acid, phospholipids have a polar group attached to the glycerol molecule. Remember, triglycerides were entirely hydrophobic because all three positions on the glycerol molecule were taken up by nonpolar fatty acids. But, phospholipids have a polar group in one place on the glycerol molecule, making phospholipids partly hydrophilic; the polar group helps to form the polar head.  The two fatty acids, maintain a hydrophobic portion of the phospholipid, the tails."
"7","Why is it wrong to show your real emotions infront of everyone else?","","Actually it isn't legally or humanly wrong to show your real emotions in public. But it's just the way our society works. Think about it, if you showed your real emotions at work, and still managed to complete your job, people would still term you as 'un-professional', because they think that that sort of behaviour would disrupt everyone else's performance (which is probably true). You see, human beings are taught to handle personal matters discretely, and if you suddenly expressed your strong emotions to a person you'd probably throw him/her offguard. And of course the real key to having successful friendships and acquaintances with people is that you can control your emotions around them. You may feel angry, but you don't directly hit out at them, right? But if you're overjoyed, well then, I guess there isn't any harm in expressing yourself. \nRemember, it isn't wrong to show your emotions (and it's good to learn to control them), it's just that people are not used to it."

There is no afterlife or reincarnation.\n\nHowever, I do think that people who do good things often see good things done to them and vice versa. This is not a hard rule. Plenty of people are terrible, yet enjoy wonderful lives. Many people are chronic do-gooders, yet suffer at every turn. However, I find that often a good deed is rewarded, if only by increasing the aggregate sense of happiness in the immediate vicinity."

"10","Why are religious, right-winged conservatives gaining more power?","","One reason, I believe, is because they have gotten more organized and more open in thier ways.  I know that many right-wing conservatives are connected with Christian religions.  I also know that many churches in the past election handed out election materials to their congregations and some preached that it was a moral necessity to vote for the right-wing conservative.  The TV evangelists were especially strong on this, but I know people who said that even in the Catholic church they preached the ""rightness"" of those who opposed abortion.\n\nAs a whole, the left-wing balance is not as organized.  And it has become complacent in the past (meaning they do not tend to vote as much).  \n\nI also know that, as a country, we tend to swing back and forth, like a pendelum.  So the more the right-wing conservatives gain power, the more vocal those in the opposite corner, and many in the middle ground become, and we eventually reach a pivot point where we cycle again toward the middle.\n\nIMHO (in my humble opinion)"

The curse was set upon chamber maids and ladys-in-waiting so that they would be careful with their mistress's mirror.\nSome would have us believe that the seven years comes from the Roman believe that life had a seven year renewal cycle and breaking a mirror while looking into it would damage the seer for seven years.  I do not put much faith into this since most Roman mirrors were usually metal and most mirrors are not being stared into when they are broken (they are usually dropped while being transported)."

I would like some advice on how to be a good teacher and some of the things i should prepare for from the students.","Obviously, go to college to be certified to teach history. You will also have to take classes in educational methods, i.e. how to teach. It would be good for you to volunteer with the age group you are interested in teaching while you are in college so you can determine if you really enjoy other people's children enough to spend hours with them every day. What I find most challenging about teaching is keeping myself from getting burnt out from everyone needing something from me all the time. You will need to remember that some students will love history, some will hate it, and most will tolerate it because it is required. You also should consider being certified in a second teaching area, because jobs teaching history are hard to come by. Often districts want teachers who can teach more than one class."

Does GOD force love?","If a King or a dictator forces his people to 'Love' him then is this love?\n\nI would say no!\n\nSo if God forces us to love Him (threatening us to burn in Hell forever if we don't), then what is the difference?","If you force someone to love you then can that compare to someone loving you with all their body, mind and words? So God is supremely merciful and all loving that he patiently gives and arranges opportunities for us to develope pure love for him. If we make mistakes, or are even averse to him, then like a loving father or mother will correct us and show us that what we are doing is wrong, and one day we will realize how God is supremely merciful upon us. Even if we have to go to hell for sometime, like a prisoner doing 'time', it is for the greater good - we will learn from our mistakes and it will bring us closer to our own happiness, and Gods happiness which is full of eterity, knowledge and bliss. \n\nGod who is very sad and unhappy to see his own near and dear loved ones seperate from himself, struggling with birth and death and so many miseries in this material world, but yet he wont interefere with your own free will, otherwise what would be the difference between us living beings and inert objects? \n\nSo actually real love comes from the heart and does not rise out of fear. Love arsing out of the fear that, 'after death I will go to hell and not heaven', is weak and enfeebled love - not pure sponateous love arsing from the absorbtion of the object of ones love. \n\nIf you are going to live with someone for the rest of eternity dont you want it to be out of love and not the fear that 'If i dont love this person he will send me to hell'?"

You should uninstall the drivers you have by going to Add/Remove Programs in the Control Panel.  You should see something along the lines of NVidia TNT Drivers or whatnot.  Reboot the computer.  A generic windows driver will be installed so that you can still see the desktop, but it will look like crap.  Go to www.nvidia.com and download the latest drivers for your specific adapter.  Once installed, reboot the system if it doesn't reboot automatically, then when you get back to windows, right click the desktop and go to properties, click the settings tab, and reset your resolution and color depth as necessary.  You can also click the advanced button and tweak your refresh rate and other video settings here.  good luck.\n\nI should add that you can also uninstall the drivers using the device manager...but the add/remove programs method will help ensure that all registry entries and whatnot are removed.

In a given geographic region, the Stone Age normally predated the invention or spread of metalworking technology. Human groups in different parts of the world began using stone tools at different times and abandoned stone for metal tools at different times. Broadly speaking, however, the Stone Age began roughly 2.5 million years ago, ended in some parts of the world 5,000 years ago, and ended in other regions much more recently. Today only a few isolated human populations rely largely on stone for their technologies, and that reliance is rapidly vanishing with the introduction of tools from the modern industrialized world.\n\nHuman ancestors living before the Stone Age likely used objects as tools, a behavior that scientists find today among chimpanzees. Wild chimpanzees in Africa exhibit a range of tool-using behaviors. For example, they use bent twigs to fish for termites, chewed wads of leaves to soak up liquid, and branches and stones as hammers, anvils, missiles, or clubs. However, when prehistoric humans began to make stone tools they became dramatically distinct from the rest of the animal world. Although other animals may use stone objects as simple tools, the intentional modification of stone into tools, as well as using tools to make other tools, appear to be behaviors unique to humans. This stone toolmaking and tool-using behavior became central to the way early humans adapted to their environment and almost certainly had a profound effect on human evolution.\n\nArchaeologists believe the Stone Age began about 2.5 million years ago because that marks the age of the earliest stone tool remnants ever discovered. The earliest recognizable stone artifacts mark the beginnings of the archaeological record—that is, the sum total of material remnants of ancient human activities. As recently as 5,000 years ago all human societies on the face of the earth were essentially still living in the Stone Age. Therefore, over 99.8 percent of humans’ time as toolmakers—from 2.5 million years ago to 5,000 years ago—took place during the Stone Age. During the Stone Age our ancestors went through many different stages of biological and cultural evolution. It was long after our lineage became anatomically modern that we began to experiment with new innovations such as metallurgy, heralding the end of the Stone Age.\nII\nStudy of the Stone Age\n\nThe term Stone Age has been used since the early 1800s as a designation for an earlier, prehistoric stage of human culture, one in which stone rather than metal tools were used. By the early 1800s various archaeological sites had been found in Europe that contained mysterious items from evidently earlier, prehistoric times. Christian Thomsen, curator of the National Museum in Copenhagen, Denmark, developed a classification scheme to organize the museum’s growing collections into three successive technological stages in the human past: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. This three-age classification was quickly adopted and spread not only among museums in Europe but also among excavators, who were able to identify Stone Age remnants that were found below Bronze Age remnants, which were in turn found below Iron Age remnants as they dug down through layers of deposits at their sites. The fact that Stone Age remnants were found at the bottom layers indicated that they were the oldest.\n\n\nThe study of the Stone Age falls under the fields of anthropolog"
"2","What is meant by Vertical Takeoff and Landing in aircrafts?.?","","It is an aircraft with modified swivel wings that does not require the aircraft to have a long runway for take off.

"4","Semester Exams-Some ways to study?","Hey, I need some extra ways to help information stick in my brain for semester exams. There is a lot of information that I'm afraid i'll forget or will get mixed up with something else.","Have you tried mnemonics? it is a technique to improve memory, and it works great when you have to remember a lot of information. Just to give you an example, say you are studying the various parts of a cell and their functions:\n\nMITOCHONDRIA: site of aerobic respiration in eukaryotic cells it is a membrane bound organelle found in greater numbers in cells with high energy demands such as muscle. Made up of internal folds called cristae it is a double membraned organelle.\n\nLYSOSOME:  organelle which contains powerful digestive enzymes which are sometimes used in ""cell suicide"".  When energy flow to the membrane from the mitochondria is interrupted, the lysosome membrane ruptures releasing its contents resulting in the destruction of the cell. Found in protozoans, sperm and egg, thyroid cells, and leukocytes.\n\nNow, how will you remember their functions? Mnemonics means you associate words together to help you remember, or make up a silly/funny sentence that helps you or make up short forms. \n\nMy examples: \nmitochondria - mighty (sounds similar) - energy\nso these are related to producing energy\n\nlysosome - last days! (based on the sounds again, L and S) - suicide!\nso this is related to the destruction of the cell\n\nHere's more detail:\nMnemonic techniques are more specific memory aids. Many are based on the general memory strategies that were presented earlier. Although it can be easiest to remember those things that you understand well, sometimes you must rely on rote memory. The following techniques can be used to facilitate such memorization.\nACRONYMS. You form acronyms by using each first letter from a group of words to form a new word. This is particularly useful when remembering words in a specified order. Acronyms are very common in ordinary language and in many fields. Some examples of common acronyms include NBA (National Basketball Associations), SCUBA (Self Contained Underwater Breathing Apparatus), BTUs (British Thermal Units), and LASER (Light Amplification by Stimulated Emission of Radiation). What other common acronyms can you think of? The memory techniques in this section, for example, can be rearranged to form the acronym ""SCRAM"" (Sentences/acrostics, Chunking, Rhymes & songs, Acronyms, and Method of loci).\n\nLet us suppose that you have to memorize the names of four kinds of fossils for your geology class: 1) actual remains, 2) Petrified, 3) Imprint, and 4) Molds or casts. Take the first letter of each item you are trying to remember: APIM. Then, arrange the letters so that the acronym resembles a word you are familiar with: PAIM or IMAP.\n\nSENTENCES/ACROSTICS. Like acronyms, you use the first letter of each word you are trying to remember. Instead of making a new word, though, you use the letters to make a sentence. Here are some examples:\n\nMy Dear Aunt Sally (mathematical order of operations: Multiply and Divide before you Add and Subtract) \nKings Phil Came Over for the Genes Special (Kingdom, Phylum, Class, Order, Genus, Species)"

"7","what is distilled water?","how is distilled water made, what is the difference between it and drinking water... things like that","Distilled water is water that has had virtually all of its impurities removed through distillation (boiling the water and collecting the steam).\n\nBecause of its relative purity, some of the properties of distilled water are significantly different from those of the water most people consume and use in everyday life.\n\nA potentially dangerous property of distilled water is that it can be heated above its boiling point without showing the normal characteristics of boiling, called superheating. When the superheated water is disturbed or has impurities added to it, a sudden, explosive boil occurs, possibly causing serious injury to anyone near it.\n\n\nOne of the reasons why you should drink filltered, spring, or drinking water over distilled water is because they contain minerals that are important for your body."

Also, in the summer, the skin is higher in the sky - you can more sunlight concentration on the areas of the skin that is exposed.\n\n5 minutes of summer sun in shorts would give you ample Vitamin D. In winter, depending on where you live and on how bright and clear the sunshine is and the amount of skin you have exposed, you might need 20 or 30 minutes a day."

Or is it just a bunch of left-wing attacks against him?   And, if he was proven to have lied, why wasn't it all over the news?","The perception is YES. The reality is NO. People are going to believe what they want. Funny how evil GWB is portrayed by some liberals when in reality, Clinton is the last proven liar in the white house. Is GW a little clumsy with his words? Does sometimes he come off a little dense? Sure. But, name the only president to be proven a liar and you find yourself a democrat. Funny...\n\nKristy is happy with Clinton's sex lies?

"3","what are the main reasons why people have schizophrenia?","","Man, most of these people are severely misinformed about the causes of schizophrenia or schizoaffective disorders.  Cats walking in your food?  Non-vegetarian diets?  Give me a freakin' break...!\n\nSchizophrenia may affect the victim who has it in many different ways and on many different levels of severity.  One may be slightly schizophrenic, or schizphrenic to the point of loss of all social functioning and ability, i.e., it can be disabling.  It is characterized chiefly by paranoia, paranoid delusions, and/or hallucinations - either auditory or visual.  ANYTHING that can affect regions of the brain responsible for vision and hearing can then alter those perceptions and yield signs that would be diagnosed as schizoaffective, for example.\n\nPhysical damage directly affecting the brain can lead to behaviors symptomatic of schizophrenia (you fall down in the park and a stick goes through the roof of your mouth into your brain and causes brain damage, or you use drugs so much that it causes chronic physical overuse of seratonin receptors which results in cellular and functional brain damage are 2 examples of things that could happen physically).\n\nThere is believed (some evidence exits) to be a genetic component to being pre-disposed to having schizophrenia, but keep in mind that most people are not born with overt schizophrenic symptoms.  This suggests that it is more of a socially generated disorder, and is caused by gross misintrepretation of one's local and global environmental states coupled with his or her lack of self-esteem and self-confidence.  Someone with a lot of self-confidence will not become paranoid that everyone is talking about them, and are less likely, therefore, to show signs of paranoia, develop delusional thoughts about conspiracy, etc...all symptoms of schizophrenia.  Someone with no self-esteem or self-confidence, on the other hand, will be more likely to think everyone is against them, that secret agencies like the CIA are pitting conspiracy against them, and that others are plotting to hurt them in some way - since these things are not really happening (that is to sayt they are delusions), this individual will be diagnosed as schizophrenic when he tells these things to his psychiatrist.  There is interestingly the commonality among schizophrenic patients that the people that are out to get them are either secret agencies or large, powerful institutions - the CIA, the FBI, the government, the IRS - this is thought to be based on the fact that the victim needs to fulfill his paranoiad delusions somehow, and these organizations are not well known so it would be difficult for someone else to refute the fact that they are or are not after him.  That is, it's hard to prove that the CIA doesn't have a file on you, because if they did they wouldn't tell you.  This is referred to as ""paranoid security"", and is common among all schizoaffective patients.\n\nSo there are a lot of reasons one ""gets"" schizophrenia - the only common factor is that the causes are related to changes in brain chemistry, as I mentioned this is either physical or chemical in nature, and can have a variety of root causes."

Of course, one's diet depended to a great extent on social class. As those considered samurai could range in means from very poor to very rich-and thus experienced diets that crossed classes-we'll examine some generalities. \n\nRice \nUnsurprisingly, rice was a staple food, and was so important as to be considered a measure of wealth. Farming in Japan has never been an especially easy affair, and the life of a farmer could be a difficult one indeed. Much of Japan is mountainous, and yet even after the land was unified under the Tokugawa, each province needed to have some rice-growing potential. A few areas were idea and by the 16th Century had come to the realm's 'breadbaskets' - especially Ise Province and the Kanto Region. The Kanto in particular was well suited to agricultural development, with wide, flat stretches of land for fields and rivers to provide irrigation. Other, more mountainous provinces, like nearby Kai, presented their lords and farmers with many problems, and required a great deal more effort to optimize production. Rice fields were cut into the sides of hills, and rivers arduously dammed and diverted. Yet the work was vital - fa"

"1","What do you think about, ahc24?","","Friends,\n\nSpiritually, I am of Israel.  Spiritually, Abraham is my forefather.  I believe and know that God’s New Covenant brings Israel and the Gentiles together through the Messiah Jesus.  My testimony is very long…\n\nI was born as a result of a promise, that my Mother made to God.  She prayed saying that if God would give her a baby girl, she would bring her up, teaching her about him… and that she would be for his work.  And so, here I am.\n\nShe never told me of this promise, until I accepted Jesus.  And I do believe that the evil spirits, namely, Satan, heard of this promise concerning me… in the presence of the Lord… as in the case of Job.  For all of my life, I have been persecuted by peoples, and I have known many demon-possessed persons, who have tried to led me further astray, into Wicca, so forth.    Nevertheless, I was a rebellious person, and I did not trust in Jesus… until I was thirteen. \n\nAs a teenager I was restless in heart.  I find that I was fearful of true Christianity… fearful to put my trust in Jesus.  I wondered if Jesus were truly real… even if God was real… but if God were not real, I wondered… why did anything exist… why did I exist… as ‘complicated’ as I am… what was I to do… where would I go after death… in my mind I am so real… how could I only cease to exist after I died?\n\nWith horrifying thoughts plaguing me more and more… I could not sleep… my heart was so restless… with wondering about religions, views… and Jesus.  \n\nThis was how the nights were until one Sunday morning.  My parents and I went to a place where a Congregation gathered for worship.  At the end of the service… the Spirit of God began convicting me… showing me that I was a sinner… calling to me… to come and accept his sacrifice and be justified… calling me to be his Disciple.  I was afraid… afraid of the call… afraid of being persecuted… extremely fearful.  And I resisted.  \n\nOh, and the week was misery and restlessness.\n\nThe next Sunday, God who is full of mercy and compassion… convicted me again… calling me to him… and I being fearful… did not know what to do… how could I resist him?  He is so loving and full of compassion… and then was the temptation of the evil one (I didn’t know it was his minions to begin with)… “you don’t need to accept… the people will laugh… they will stare at you for accepting.”  But there was the first step… and afterward the temptation fled… I believed in my heart that Jesus was Lord… I confessed that Jesus is Lord… believing that God raised him from the dead.  \n\nAnd so, I was justified in the sight of God. \n\nBut, instead of continuing in my sanctification… I became lukewarm.  No one taught about God’s image… no one taught about knowing God personally… they only preached what they wanted to hear about the Gospel.  \n\nNevertheless, I became tired of the ignorance around me.  Mainly… tired of MY ignorance.  I began praying, searching for God… asking God “where are you,” “what are you like?”  and praying “Lord, I really want to know you, I want to know you as Father, Son, and Spirit, I want to KNOW you.”  My prayers were constantly before the Father and intense in emotion.  Because I wanted to know his living and active words, I wanted to hear him, I wanted to really know him.  I wanted him to ‘be’ my Wonderful Counselor.  My human father had died, and I wanted my HEAVENLY FATHER.\n\nI knew that if the Prophets and the Apostles heard God… I could too.  I knew that if the Holy Spirit poured out the love of God into the hearts of the early Christians… he could pour out his love into my heart. (Romans 5:5)\n\nI became more and more aware of the spiritual part of our world… and I became closer and closer to God, through Jesus my Messiah.  God began to be nigh because I wanted to be nigh to him.  God really does speak.  I can call out “Abba” and he has said “H"

"5","Can anyone expand PDA and tell about it?","","Personal digital assistants (also called PDAs or palmtops) are handheld devices that were originally designed as personal organizers, but became much more versatile over the years. A basic PDA usually includes date book, address book, task list, memo pad, clock, and calculator software. Many PDAs can now access the Internet via Wi-Fi, cellular or Wide-Area Networks (WANs) or Bluetooth technology. One major advantage of using PDAs is their ability to synchronize data with a PC or home computer.\n\nThe term ""personal digital assistant"" was coined on January 7, 1992 by John Sculley at the Consumer Electronics Show in Las Vegas, Nevada, referring to the Apple Newton. Earlier devices like the Psion and Sharp Wizard have the functionality to be considered PDAs, however. In fact, PDAs by other names were available as early as the mid-1970s -- first as very advanced calculators, then as electronic organizers, and later as palmtops. [1].\n\nPDAs are some times refered to as ""Palms"" or ""Palm Pilot"" after an early PDA created by Palm, Inc.

"3","What is the best vegetarian way to cure the common cold?","No chicken noodle please!  O and i've already tried vitamin c, zinc, oj, water, tea with honey, and echinacea","The best way to cure a cold is to not get one in the first place.  Believe it or not its not normal to catch a cold. I may get a cold every 4 years or so, and generally only catch one under stressful conditions, when I mess with my sleep and don't eat right.  \n\nIf you have a cold its your body's way of saying my immune system is weakened.  \n\nTO AVOID CATCHING COLDS EVER:\n\n1)Make sure you control stress in your life, \n2) that you are eating properly (Is your vegetarian diet created by a nutritionist so that you don't get ill because you lack proper nutrients? or did you just create it yourself by deciding not to eat meat? Be healthy and make sure your diet is meeting your own bodys requirements) \n3)get proper rest for your body(generally between 7-10hrs a night sleep), \n4) Maintain routine schedules (eating, sleeping, exercise, etc). \n5) Wash your hands regularly and throughly throughout the day. \n6) During high cold seasons when several people around you are sick, use a plain SALINE NASAL spray throughout the day. \n7) Take a well balanced multi-vitamin daily. High doses of Vit c (500mg) are good for you.  \n8) Exercise regulary.   \n\nOnce you have a cold the best way to treat it is to treat the symptoms with medicine (Tylenol Cold), get plenty of rest (16hrs), drink lots of water and liquids, eat several small light meals (avoid carrots and other vegetables that are hard to digest. You don't want you body spending the energy to digest hard foods when you are ill. Soups, oatmeal,veg broths,oranges, are good to include) And give it a few days to past.  Your body will heal itself if it is healthy enough."

But I don't know too many people in my class in college. Since I'm graduating sorta early, all my peers are graduating next year, so I'm kind of ambivalent on the whole thing.","I was hesitant about walking also, mainly because I really didn't know any of my peers in my graduating class either.  However, I did because there was that whole parental guilt trip thing ""We've waited so long to see you graduate!""  I also did find out that some colleges, mainly the larger universities, don't even have ceremonies where their graduates walk.  All their graduates do is just stand up when their specific school/major is announced.  That's pretty lame because you get no recognition whatsoever.  So if your ceremony actually will call your name, I don't think it would be so bad to attend."

"10","Do you know the pedge of allegiance? Do you mean it when you say it?","","Yes, I know the peldge of allegiance. and Yes I very much so mean it when I say it ever time I say it. The reason being is that i have a husband that served in the united states of america, a friend whom just passed whom served, and a high scholl friend whom just got back nhome from the iraqi war. And to military personell it holds great meaning that if we are not a country that is willing to stand for its beliefs, it politics, it people and their rights, and to believe in god what would become of all of us would we just stop caring, fighting for our rights, and not believeing that their is a god who watches over us. Not this family we strongly believe in the pledge of alleigance and always will not mattter what. And one other thing before I go The most touching thing that I have seen recently and really didn't understand it is when I attended my husbands friends funeral whom just passed his family gave him a military funeral and when they salute the flag and the military personell and you see the flag draped over the casket it hits you like a ton of bricks right in the heart, you start to understand that all of the service members out here fighting for all of us are doing it because it is something to believe in and love for our country and then when they fold the flag and give it to the the family and they hold it in their hands and you see the pain and hurt in their eyes and hearts you can only appreciate the time and the service that they done for their country and it hits home right to the heart, and then when they salute the final salute to the service members whom has passed or whom is comming home it touches you in the deepest part of your heart. So when you ask do I mean it yes yes YES I DO! My final thought is never forget that we as a country need to fight for what is ours, and we are one nation and we need to be proud, and appreciate what our service members previous, yesterday, today, and tommorow are fighting for and salute them for all of the heroic things that they go through because they believe in one nation under god and want to protect it so shouldn't we also. Thank you for the question and I appreciate you asking this. God Bless"

I have not been dating anybody for the past three years and once in a while I would feel like having fun and as such start masturbating.I know it is wrong and have tried many times to stop but at times the urge will be so high that I would just relent and do it again, afterwhich I would feel so useless and dirty. It is really disturbing me!","Well, for one there is nothing to feel guilty or ""dirty"" about.  It is something that is perfectly natural.  In fact, there are a lot of animals that do it, not just humans.\n\nAs long as you are not doing it to excess (multiple times a day) or letting it distract you from your day-to-day life, I would not worry about it.  I am a single female, and I do it on average a few times a week.  Even when I am not single, I still wiw it at least several times a month.\n\nBesides, there have been some studies that say it may actually be good for you.  It raises blood pressure and heart rate, and burns off calories.  And the endorphins and hormones released have benefits including the lowering of blood pressure, long-term endorphins that relieve stress, and it can even reduce menstral cramps and migranes."

"2","how many blood types are in a humanbody?","","Humans have the following blood types along with their respective antigens and antibodies:\n\n    * Individuals with type A blood have red blood cells with antigen A on their surface and produce antibodies against antigen B in their blood serum. Therefore an A-negative person can only receive blood from another A-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n    * Individuals with type B blood have the opposite arrangement, antigen B on their cells and produce antibodies against antigen A in their serum. Therefore, a B-negative person can only receive blood from another B-negative person or from an O-negative person.\n    * Individuals with type AB blood have red blood cells with both antigens A and B and do not produce antibodies against either antigen in their serum. Therefore, a person with type AB-positive blood can safely receive any ABO type blood and is called a ""universal receiver"". However an AB-positive person cannot donate blood except to another AB-positive person.\n    * Individuals with type O blood have red blood cells with neither antigen but produce antibodies against both types of antigens. Therefore, a person with type O-negative blood can safely donate to a person with any ABO blood type and is called a ""universal donor"". However an O-negative person can only receive blood from another O-negative person.\n\nOverall, the O blood type is the most common blood type in the world, although in some areas, such as Sweden and Norway, the A group dominates. The A antigen is overall more common than the B antigen. Since the AB blood type requires the presence of both A and B antigens, the AB blood type is the rarest of the ABO blood types. There are known racial and geographic distributions of the ABO blood types. \n\nThe precise reason why people develop antibodies against an antigen they have never been exposed to is unknown. It is believed that some bacterial antigens are similar enough to the A and B glycoproteins, and that antibodies created against the bacteria will react to ABO-incompatible blood cells.\n\nApart from red blood cells, the ABO antigen is also expressed on the glycoprotein von Willebrand factor (vWF), which participates in hemostasis (control of bleeding). In fact, blood type O predisposes very slightly to bleeding, as vWF is degraded more rapidly. ABO antigens are also present in many other tissues such as liver, kidneys and lungs\n\nThe H antigen:\nThe A & B antigens are derived from a common precursor known as the H antigen. The H antigen is a glycosphingolipid (sphingolipid with carbohydrates bonded to the ceramide moiety) which is modified to produce the A and B antigens. In type O blood, it remains unchanged and consists of a chain of glucose, galactose, N-acetyl galactosamine, and fucose attached to the ceramide. Since it lacks N-acetylneuraminic acid (sialic acid) it is referred to as a globoside, not a ganglioside. Type A has an extra N-acetyl galactosamine bonded to the galactose near the end, while type B has a third galactose bonded to that near-end galactose."

"7","why do they wait to burie the casket until the family leaves the ground?","","My very first job before getting into radio was a grounds keeper at a local ""Memorial Park"", as we liked to call it.  I have first hand knowlege on this subject.  Our grave yard was situated on a hillside.  This sometimes meant that we had to actually dig the graves by hand instead of using a backhoe.  Anyway, I hate to say that sometimes the casket does not make a gracefull landing in the vault.  One time we were burrying this man, and his casket was oversized, and his family only ordered a normal size vault(the vault is the cement box that the casket is put into) After the fmily left, we had to take the handles off of the casket to make it fit.  It was a tight fit, but we finally got him in.  One time (i was not working there for this one) A groundskeeper was lowering a casket, he did not wait until the family left the cemetary, and seeing as how the grave was in a hilly area as he lowered the casket, he had to use his foot to guide the casket down.  The family totally flipped out, they thought this guy was jumping up and down on their relitive.  So to answer your question, they usually wait for the family to leave...because accidents can happen."

I just don't know how much Tracy and Cano are going to improve.","I'd go with Chone Figgins, myself.  I don't know how your league values players that can play multi positions, but I've always found that players like that are exceedingly more valuable than players at only one spot.  Not only that, but Chone is only going to get better and better, he's young and already kickin' butt and takin' names!"

"7","How old do you have to be to have died of old age?","","Interesting question Pharos91. \n\nOn the face of it you could just pick and age like 70, 80, 90, etc. But it isn't quite as simple as that. The majority of people die when they are old but few actually die of old age. Most die of an illness or disease of some description and that is not the same as dying of old age. \n\nAs an example. My two grandmothers both died at an old age. One had suffered a heart condition for thirty years and finally died age 96. She died as the result of a heart attack. The other simply went to sleep one night and never woke up again. She was 101. There was no evidence of any medical condition, her organism had nothing left to give and merely  quit working. She died of old age.\n\nSo, in answer to your question. A person dies of old age when the body has used up all of its resources and the organism ceases to function of its own accord. And since that will depend on what resources there were to start with, you can't simply apply a label like 70, 80 or 90."

This is what's on the back of the book:\n\n""Wolves and pnathers and bears roamed the deep Wisconsin woods in the 1860's.  Still, Laura Ingalls' father perferred to live miles away from the nearest neighbors.  So Pa built a snug cabin for Ma, Laura, mary and Baby Carrie.  He hunted and trapped and farmed.  Ma made her own cheese and sugar.  All night long, the wind holwed lonesomely, but Pa played his fiddle and sang, keeping the family safe and cozy.""\n\nIt's basically a story about a Laura and her family's adventures of living in a cabin in the woods.

"2","If a space probe were to go to another galaxy, is there a likeliness of a whole new race of inteligent life?","It's amazing to see what the world has accomplished these days. It would be awesome to see a space probe go to the Adromeda galaxy o sombrero galaxy. Though they are millions of lightyears away, our milky way galaxy will one day collide with the Adromeda galaxy. t would be amazing to have a space probe send back pictures.","A probe going to another galaxy may indeed find life. It could also be inellegent. The only problem is that it would (with current and planned technology) take centuries for the probes to arrive.The fastest spacecraft we have today is the one heading for pluto. It will take ten years just to get there and that's in our own solar system. There may be life elsewhere even in our own galaxy. But there are literally billions of stars just in the Milky Way Galaxy. The cost of space flight will prohibit extensive exploration, at least for the forseeable future. As for the race of hypothetical beings, It is hard to imagine that with the randomness and sheer numbers of life on earth as an example, we'd find similar beings in terms of physical appearance.\nOne more issue would be the radiation damage a space probe would incur during a flight of this duration. Even a short time in space is damaging for complex and sensative objects (human and machine). Cosmic radiation floods space with sub-atomic particles traveling at or near the speed of light. Those particles pierce and pass through what ever it is they run into (except several very dense elements). The damage occurs to the probe on a microscopic level. The eletronics, computer chips and sensors begin to look like swiss cheese after enough exposure. There may be solutions to these problems in the future, but for now they are another prohibitive factor for extensive space exploration."

"4","What effects did railroads play in westward expansion?","","Lots. They didn't have trucks or higways back then. If farmers wanted to ship their crops to market, it had to go by riverboat or train. Towns that had railroads prospered; town's that didn't dried up and blew away.\n\nThe cattle drives that you read about were cowboys taking their cattle to rail yards in Kansas, where the cattle were shipped east to be made into steaks and shoes. Texas didn't have any railroads at first.\n\nLots of towns didn't have reliable water transportation, so they needed railroads. Just HAVING 160 (320, 640) acres of corn, wheat or barley didn't make a farmer rich; he had to ship it to market to sell it. \n\nA train could carry hundreds of times more than a horse-drawn wagon, and do it cheaper. That cut down on the transportation cost, which in turn made it economically possible to grow wheat in Nebraska and Kansas, but sell it to New York."

"9","What are your best tips for keeping the passion alive in a long, long, LONG term relationship?","","Ok, I had been with my old man for 15 years, so I might have some ideas for you. \n\nDon't get into a routine if you can help it (Sex only on Sat night. that kind of thing).Be spotanious, and try differnt times of day, differnt places in the house (not just the bed) differnt places (the car, the beach, the pool or jacccuzzi). \n\nAlso add toys, DVD's (make them or buy them), and flavored body gels &oils. Have fun with food, fruit, honey, syrup...use you imagination.\n\nAlso take time every once in a while to get real romantic foe no particular occasion, go all out, get your hair & nails done, buy new lingerie & set the mood with candles, music and flowers. \n\nRole playing can be fun too, go to local bar, have him go there too and pretend like you are meeting each other for the first time. Either you pick him up, or have him pick you up. Ask questions like you really don't know everything about each other you might discover something new! \n\nOh, this is a good one too, send him sexy or romantic emails at work (if he won't get in trouble), or leave sexy messages on his cell phone voice mail. Also you can put sexy notes or photos in his briefcase, so he finds them when he least expects it. \n\nHave flowers delivered to his office just to say 'I love you"", but not for any special occasion. \n  \nAnd most importantly, especially if you have kids make sure that you go on ""dates"" and make time for each other outside the house. Also make time when you send the kids away and have the house to yourself so you can run around naked all day!! We always would trade weekends with other couples who had kids so we would watch their kids one weekend, and they would watch our one weekend. It’s cool because you don't have to spend money on a sitter (use it for your date instead), and you help out another couple who probably needs a break from the kids as much as you do! \n\nAlso, this is my best passion saving tip I can give you...No matter what every year take a vacation with just your hunny, no kids, no relative house, even if it is only for 1 or 2 nights. Go to an exotic location or just a nice hotel in the city closest to you. This will do more to help you remember why you feel in love and ignite passion in your relationship. No one is too busy or too broke to find 1 night a year to do something really special!! \n\nI want to let you know that if you start to do some of this stuff, let him know you expect to be pampered also and challenge him to surprise you with romance also. Make it a fun game you can both play and you will both come out winners!! \n \nI hope this helps you!"

They have an average of 500 with a standard deviation of 100 (which means that, all things considered, two scores that are less than 100 points apart are not significantly different from one another).\n\nThere are some differences in the ""average"" of each group that takes the test. So there are also percentile rank scores given, which can give you some idea of how you did compared to others who took the test. Percentile ranks range from about 1 to 99. A percentile rank of 83 means that you scored as well or higher than 83 out of 100 students who took the test when you did.\n\nGraduate schools tend to look at the verbal and the quantitative sections, and many don't really know what the analytical section means. Higher scores are generally considered to signal greater likelihood of success in graduate school. Different programs and different degree levels have different expectations for minimum GRE scores. Doctoral programs generally require higher minimum scores than masters programs, competitive schools want higher scores than less competitive schools.\n\nHope this helps."

"5","pat/nat translations?","when they are used","There is a common misconception about PAT and NAT.\n\nPAT\nThis is a many to one solution. In this situation you have multiple machines talking to one firewall and then the firewall talks to the destination machine with your information but with the firewall as the return address. The firewall then receives the information the passes it on to you with the received IP being the orginal distant end.\n\nNAT\nWith NAT you need to have multiple ARIN routable IPs assigned to the public side of the firewall. This allows your private IPs to pick up a public firewall IP and hold on to it when talking. This is what many companies do to protect their webservers. When they have multiple inside webservers with multiple inside IPs they program the firewall to point one outside IP to a specific inside IP.\n\nMost home routers from linksys and dlink use PAT but they just call it NAT since this is how everyone knows it."

I can forgive people for things they've done to me, and they can do likewise. \n\nBut if you're asking whether humans can take away someone's guilt by forgiving them, then no. When we sin against someone, we also sin against God, because we're rebelling against the way He made us. So only God can forgive us and take away our guilt.\n\nIs this what you were asking?

"7","How are mortgage stocks effected (ie CMO, IMH) by interest rate hikes?","","As interest rates fall people will refinance at the new lower rates. Investors in mortgage backed securities with have their principal returned to them early. This is known as ""reinvestment risk"", as investors will have to find a new place for the money and the interst rates will be lower. CMO's try to midigate this risk by establishing trantches (www.investopedia.com/terms/t/tranches.asp).\n\nAs interest rates rise pre-payments will decline reducing reinvestment risk. However, the investor will still be exposed to interest rate risk. Meaning that new issues of mortgage backed securities will offer higher returns. The rates of default will increase for marginal borrowers with adjustable rates. In most cases this won't affect the investor, as the bank will foreclose and liquidate the asset. In both cases you will have credit risk, but this in minor, as they are backed by the assets (properties).\n\n* Use this information at your own risk. Consult your financial advisor."
"7","is money life? my family says n obut i think its the only thing that can get you somewhere in life.RIGHT?","","I would say life is separate from money, but the good news is you can have both and they're not mutually exclusive. You can be a millionaire and have a soul too, but the money has little to do with it. There's nothing wrong with wanting to make money.\nMoney will help you buy things that can help you achieve experiences that will make your life ""richer"" in a sense: freedom, travel, education, health, etc. It buys you possibilities.\nI recommend you read books about personal finance; the more the better. Also listen to audio books. You'll all this in the library starting with code 332."

No one's found a counterexample, but no one's proved it either."

"5","If they make DVD recorders for you to back-up your movies, then why do they put those copyright blockers on?","","My understanding of the law is that you are allowed to make a backup copy of a DVD that you make.  For example a DVD movie of you and your friend.  \n\nYou are not allowed under the law to buy a DVD of a Hollywood movie and then back it up to your Hard drive.  \n\nFor example in the united States you are allowed to buy a Music CD and rip it into a MP3 file on your computer yet for movies this is not allowed.  \n\nI was watching a episode #1 of on confused Nerd TV and they were talking about this exact situation.\n\nHere is a copy of conversation they were having.\n\nBandwidth is not decreasing, you know. It's an incredible lesson, when I first put my server together over six years ago it was a little bit of a strain. It could barely compress things in real time. Now I stick a CD in there and get it all ripped and compressed in under five minutes. It's just little corner of most people's hard disks. So the next things are the movies, which have an order of magnitude size of information, so I've started doing those as well. I put together a movie server for myself that now has over 500 works on it.\nBob: Really?\nAndy: It's illegal, because one of the worst laws I'm aware of, the DMCA says that even though I buy the DVD I can't copy it onto my computer.\nBob: I forgot you are a criminal.\nAndy: I'm a criminal in more ways than one.\nBob: Our new Attorney-General will be watching this.\n\n\nhttp://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/transcripts/001.html\n\nYou can watch episode #1 here.\nhttp://www.pbs.org/cringely/nerdtv/shows/"

They don't mean any harm in it.  It is just how they work.  Men and Women just work diferently and it is up to us to remind them of the other things in life - believe it or not..thats why they chose us.  You have to compromise.  I may not think that some things are very inportant, but he may think that same thing is invaluable.  I have to adjust to make sure he is happy and HE has to do the same.  If you clean up the house to show him that his beliefs are inportant you may have a better chance of getting the attention that you feel is important.  My compromise was .....bear with me.....that if we had sex more often - on occasion we would get back to making love.  It worked.  I work to make sure his needs are met - in all facets of marriage - in return he works on mine.  It is an endless struggle to make sure everyone is happy -- GOOD LUCK"

"2","Why have sandstone, and limestone been used as building materials for thousands of years?","","Both materials are natural sedimentary rocks. As hardened ancient sediments that become hard resulting from time and burial.  Both limestone and sandstone tend to break into flat layers that can be further broken into squared-off chuncks.  That squared-off shape serves well for construction. Try building a wall with round stones.  Both sandstone and limestone also  last well in the face of the elements of weather.   Sandstone is a little better at lasting against the weather than limestone, but limestone is a little easier to work with for the stone worker, since the mineral calcite which it is composed of, is softer.  Students can go to look at dated burial stones with their dates to learn how these to material stand up to the weather.   They will see that dates on monuments made of limestone and marble (composed of the same mineral) tend to become more faint with time than dates on  sandstone monuments.  Even so both sandstone and limestone monuments last hundreds of years. In dry climates such as Egypt limestone building stone such as in the Pyramids lasts nearly as well as sandstone.\n\n In brief sandstone and limestone are abundant natural materials that are long-lasting and can be easily formed into a useful squared-off shape."

"2","why is it that if one person yawns someone near to him also yawns simultaneously.?","","From straightdope.com:\n\n""nobody really knows. Fact is, we don't know why people yawn, period.\n\nIt was long believed you yawned when there was too much carbon dioxide and not enough oxygen in your blood. A part of your brain called the brain stem detected this and triggered the yawn reflex. Your mouth stretched wide and you inhaled deeply, shooting a jolt of oxygen into the lungs and thence to the bloodstream.\n\nSubsequently, you exhaled a lot of CO2. Often you'd stretch while yawning, which seemed to temporarily improve circulation. You yawned and stretched a lot more when you got tired because your breathing slowed down.\n\nOr so people thought. In recent years, though, a few radicals have said the preceding is all malarkey. Who knows, they say, maybe we yawn because it's too warm in the room.\n\nCecil isn't about to settle the issue here, and he doesn't need to. We merely observe that whatever yawn-inducing conditions prevail for you also apply to your friends.\n\nIf you're out late in some crowded dive, you're probably all tired, all warm under the collar, and all breathing the same stale air. You're probably all on the verge of a yawn, too, and the power of suggestion from seeing one person do it is enough to push everybody else over the edge.\n\nAdults rarely catch a case of the yawns from a child or animal, which tends to corroborate this idea.\n\nChildren usually have different sleep schedules and respiration rates from adults, so you would expect them to yawn at different times. Animals, on the other hand, often yawn not for physiological reasons but as a display of hostility, to which humans are evidently unresponsive."""

"2","What is a shock wave?","all I know is it happens after a blast but I want to know sintifically what is happinging.","When an object (or disturbance) moves faster than the information about it can be propagated into the surrounding fluid, fluid near the disturbance cannot react or ""get out of the way"" before the disturbance arrives. In a shock wave the properties of the fluid(density, pressure, temperature, velocity, Mach number) change almost instantaneously. Measurements of the thickness of shock waves have resulted in values approximately one order of magnitude greater than the mean free path of the gas investigated.\n\nShock waves are not sound waves; a shock wave takes the form of a very sharp change in the gas properties on the order of micro-meters in thickness. Shock waves in air are heard as a loud ""crack"" or ""snap"" noise. Over time a shock wave can change from a nonlinear wave into a linear wave, degenerating into a conventional sound wave as it heats the air and loses energy. The sound wave is heard as the familiar ""thud"" or ""thump"" of a sonic boom, commonly created by the supersonic flight of aircraft.\n\nEveryone's familiar with the sonic boom from passing jets - that's a shock wave - but so is a balloon popping!

"2","Hydrodynamics in two glasses. Will the ball move?","Two identical glasses (cylinders) with small orifices in their bottoms are connected by a flexible tube attached to the orifices. The glasses are filled with equal amounts of water and placed at the same level. A small ball is put inside the tube. You start stirring water (rotating it by a tea-spoon) in one of the glasses. Will the ball move? If yes, in which direction? Does the answer depend on the position of the orifices with respect to the centers of the glass bottoms?","yes, it will move.  the phenomenon responsible is known as the bernoulli effect,  and its most basic statement is that ""in a flowing fluid, an increase in flow rate causes a decrease in pressure"".  what you have constructed is essentially a kind of venturi tube, which is often used to illustrate the bernoulli effect.  here is a great page about venturis and the bernoulli effect:\nhttp://home.earthlink.net/~mmc1919/venturi.html\n\nso anyway, when you stir the water in the glass, it moves faster.  if the orifice is underneath a region of quickly-moving water, the pressure above the orifice will be decreased.  this will cause the ball in the tube to move towards the lower-pressure area (that is, the glass you stir).  \n\nif the orifice is in the center of the glass, then the water will not be moving very quickly, and the pressure will be higher there.  towards the outer edge of the glass, the water will be moving fast, so this will cause a relative decrease in the hydrodynamic pressure.  so, i would reason that the closer the orifice is to the edge of the glass, the greater the movement of the ball."
"3","I would like to learn more about Indian aeromeda - a sort of philosophy about the treatment of illnesses.?","","Hey do you mean Ayurveda?\n\nAyurveda (आयुर्वेद Sanskrit: ayu—life; veda—knowledge of) or ayurvedic medicine is a more than 2,000 year old comprehensive system of medicine based on a holistic approach rooted in Vedic culture. Its conspicuous use of the word veda, or knowledge, reveals its role in early Hinduism and describes its hallowed place in India. Ayurveda also had a tradition of surgery. Two early texts of Ayurveda are the Charaka Samhita and the Sushruta Samhita.\n\nThe Charaka and Sushruta Samhitās are compendiums of two traditions rather than texts authored by single authors. A third tradition is that of the Kāshyapas. The scholarly traditions of ayurveda date back to the time of the Buddha, who died (mahaparinirvana) in approximately 400 BCE. Some plant remedies of ayurveda are mentioned in the earlier Vedic literature 2nd millennium BC, but the formal doctrines of the three humours and other key ayurvedic ideas are first mentioned in the Buddhist Canonical literature. Both the Sushruta and Charaka Samhitās are the product of several editorial hands, having been revised and supplemented over a period of several hundred years.\n\nThe scholar Vāgbhata, who lived in Sind at the beginning of the 7th century AD, produced a grand synthesis of earlier ayurvedic materials in a verse work called Ashtānga Samhita. Another work associated with the same author, the Asthanga Samgraha, contains much the same material in a more diffuse form, written in a mixture of prose and verse. The relationship between these two works, and a third intermediate compilation, is still a topic of active research. The works of Charaka, Sushruta, and Vagbhata are considered canonical and reverentially called the Vriddha Trayi, ""the triad of ancients""; or Brhat Trayi, ""the greater triad."" In the early eighth century, Mādhav wrote his Nidāna, a work on etiology, which soon assumed a position of authority. In the 79 chapters of this book, he lists diseases along with their causes, symptoms, and complications.\n\nThe vast majority of Ayurvedic therapies are herbal compounds. Some alchemical preparations start to enter the ayurvedic pharmacopieia towards the end of the 1st millennium AD in works such as those of Ugraditya (8th century AD)and Sarngadhara (14th century AD). It also provides therapies for the treatment of various vegetable and animal toxins like scorpion, spider and snake venom. It has a whole science of toxicology called agada-tantra as one of the eight branches of traditional Ayurveda.\n\nThe Ayurvedic idea is that the organism adapts to the environment and its food, climate etc. This principle of adaptation is called satyma. Through introducing small amounts of a food or medicine, the organism can adapt to it and learn to resist it.\n\nAyurveda became increasingly symptom-based, treating the symptoms of a disease rather than the root cause. However, it is important to note that Ayurveda was originally a consciousness based system of health care. Its philosophy, expressed in modern terms, is to strengthen the immune system.\n\n\nQualities\nIt could be said that the simple essence of ayurveda is knowledge and awareness of the qualities of nature – called gurvadi gunah. By understanding the qualities inherent in the environment, in foodstuffs, in activities, etc., one gains an appreciation of their effects on the individual constitution through the principle of similarities; i.e., that similarities cause increase while dissimilarities cause decrease. Thus hot qualities in the environment or diet will increase hot qualities in the body.\n\nThe gurvadi gunah are listed in Vagbhata's Ashtanga Hrdayam as:\n\nGuru (heavy) – laghu (light) \nManda (slow) – tikshna (quick, sharp) \nHima (cold) – ushna (hot) \nSnigdha (unctuous) – ruksha (dry) \nSlakshna (smooth) – khara (rough) \nSandra (solid) – drava (liquid) \nMrdu (soft) – kathina (hard) \nSthira (stable) – cala (mobile) \nSuk"
"2","What is the nature of fire. Is it energy or is it plasma?","","Fire is an energy-releasing plasma.  I think it's more correct to call it a plasma because fire dies, but the energy it liberated remains, and the plasma--meaning the ionized gases--cease to exist once the fire is dead."
"2","How is that we can smell cold water but hot water the most?","","This has to do with what is called diffusion.  Molecules in a gas or liquid medium spread out so that they are dispersed evenly throughout the whole medium.  As molecules in the water move around, some escape into the air.  The moecules move slower when they are cold then when they are hot.  In addition, less molecules escape when the water is cold than when it is hot.  Anyway, when the cold water molecules escape into the air, they diffuse out.  When water is hot or boiling, steam is formed.  At this rate, more water molecules escape and the ones that do move faster because they contain added energy from the heat.  The cold water molecules are fewer and slower; therefore, they take longer to diffuse to the air in and around your nose.  The hot water molecules are more numerous and move more quickly; therefore, they are quicker to diffuse to the air in and around your nose.  I hope this helps."

As the curve ball spins, the velocity of the skin relative to the air surrounding the ball on its path is different on opposite sides of the ball, creating a slight vacuum altering the course of the ball.  You can shape your hands and fingers to simulate the special curvature of a baseball skin and seems.\n\nThe baseball skin was invented in my home town of Stoughton, Mass. where I believe they were going to erect a suitable monument at one time.  At the baseball Hall of Fame in Cooperstown, I saw only a small faded news article, within a glass case filled with the oldest baseballs, that even mentioned the invention.  I'm glad you asked."
"5","What is the largest LCD Monitor I could use effectively using 3D Max?","I was looking into the Viewsonic n2750w 27"" HDTV that actually was on G4 TV as a good gaming monitor. I was under the understanding that too big can make computer ""graphics"" blurry.","One of the most important factors, that nobody else ever seems to care about (and it pisses me off to no end), is the RESOLUTION of the monitor. And I've never seen an LCD tv that has a resolution higher than 1280*1024 (an ""amazing"" performance, achieved in the last millennium by over 99% of the common 17"" CRT monitors and many 15"" monitors too).\n\nThe 27"" beast you mention makes no exception; its resolution is even lower: 1280*720. My Viewsonic VA1912w (19"") already beats it (1440*900) and my (older) 19"" CRT totally humiliates it (1600*1200). Even my 15"" laptop screen has 1400*1050.\n\nWhat this means (having a HUGE monitor with a low resolution) is that you won't have more pixels on the screen (actually, you'll probably have less), but the pixels will be larger.\nJust like zooming into a low-resolution image. It gets bigger but it doesn't look any better.\n\nNow, 1280*1024 is plenty enough for TV (and HDTV), so that display is perfectly good for watching TV, from a comfortable distance. And this is the key: it is a TV, not a computer monitor! It's probably good enough for games too, because games don't need very high resolutions. What matters for games is the low latency for fast and impressive action.\n\nHowever, if you want to do serious graphics, don't settle for anything less than 1600*1200. It's just not worth it. And you can find that resolution (or higher) in LCD monitors (not TVs!) starting from 20""."

Since the parents have not vowed to relinquished their loyalty to their home country they are not ""subject to the jurisdiction thereof"" of the U.S.  This will likely be heatedly debated for the next few years until the illegal immigration problem in this country is worked out.\n\nRegardless, the Canadian parents still need to go through the naturalization process...they cannot ""automatically"" become citizens."

I hope they’re helpful for you.\n\nLastly, have you checked to make sure the name you're using is truly available? Prior to investing your time, money & effort into a name, it is strongly advised that comprehensive research be conducted to ensure that the name you're interested in is truly available. \n\nThis entails searching the pending & registered Federal and State trademark files as well as the US National Common-Law files. Then, if clear, you can decide if you would like to file for a Federal or a State trademark. \n\nResearch is needed to make sure your trade name is legally available, before opening, before expansion, before incorporation or before designing your logo. Similarities in sound, appearance and meaning affect you too!\n\nThere are 16+ million trade names in use in the United States. Similar names matter, if close in sound, appearance or meaning. Similar names in related classes, distribution channels and customer matter too. You are affected by Common Law use (14 million), State Trademarks (500,000) and Federal Trademarks (2 million)."

"2","why is 72 degrees the ideal temperture?","","72 Degrees is the temperature at which our body heat is comfortably exchanged with our surrounding environment (air).\n\nIn cold weather, like 30-40 degrees Farenheit, notice that the heat from our bodies is lost very quickly, leaving us feeling very cold, very fast.   The quickness of the exchange is relatively uncomfortable because our body cannot generate heat as quickly as it is losing it.\n\nIn warmer weather, above 72 degrees F, the opposite will happen.  Our bodies generate the same amount of heat, but we can't cool off fast enough.   That's why we start to sweat (a body cooling method), pant like dogs, and start looking for shade and cool showers..  We are trying to get rid of that ""extra"" heat.   \n\nSo 72 is the ideal temp at which our bodies are in balance with our environment.   Not too hot, but not too cold either."

It's more a reflection of logic connections than specifying physical components.  It's not a network of computers or processors.  It is a network of neurons.  These neurons (the net) may indeed be spread out over the network or amongst CPUs or servers or workstations, but that's merely an implementation description, not how they work."
"10","Is media biased?","Is there more bias toward liberal or conservative views?","media is business above everything else. one should understand this before blindly taking in everything that is put forth. Most media organizations have inclinations towards certain political parties and corporate clients. While it is important to keep up ethics, it isnt always easy to do so. the media industry , just like any other industry is pressurised for various issues by various sources. For example , a newspaper might receive huge ad revenue from say a car manufacturer. If that car company launches a new product, the newspaper will be pressurised to cover the event and give it a positive slant though that is not exactly what the newspaper's editorial team would want to do if they werent pressurised into doing so by marketing and sales department. Likewise, a channel which receives majority of its funding from a political party , either directly of indirectly, would put forth stories only in favor of that particular party. Though the stories might appear not appear to be taking stands, subtly and subconsciously , the language used in the script would very discreetly influence the audience and fashion a change in the attitude of the end viewer. This is how we develop certain views about certain issues. This not only applies to an individual but also to the society at large. Continuous exposure to similar content that puts forth sterotypical views about certain issues cause the end receiver to develop the same views as most forms of media are assertive and suggestive rather than interactive. \n\nSo, the question whether the media is biased is a very broad. It is a business at the end of the day and it is how you look at it and how you take it. If you can read between lines and assess what is shown on screen, it isnt biased. But if you cant to do it, yes it is biased. I would say, the media business is a pure play of human psychology. While there isnt anything that is false that is being put forth , one should understand that it isnt entirely true either. So, it all depends on how you look at it and whether you allow the businessmen to play with your weakenesses."

Anakin, certainly is no match for Yoda either and I think he would be to twisted for even Yoda to bring him back by now. \n\nSidious must now take on a new apprentice, but he still succeeds in creating the Empire, although weaker without the power of Vader to help him. Obi Wan isn't able to deliver Luke or watch over him, or influence him to join the rebellion. Yoda still has him transported to ""his family"" and after Owen and Veru are slain he joins the Academy to become a gifted pilot in the rebellion. \n\nHan is never employed by Ben to fly to Alderan, and Leia is executed by General Tarken as planned, prior to the rescue. \n\nR2D2's plans never make it to the rebellion and they are ultimately destroyed. Luke is captured by the Emperor once he realizes someone that strong in the force exists. Luke, without the influence of Ben and Yoda, is easily converted and trained in the Dark Side from scratch (probably killing off the interim apprentice). \n\nThe Sith rule for 1000 years."

Bcoz of his HATE LETTER TO THE FILIPINOS... Here read...\n\n-------------------------\n\nFilipinos.....*make me puke* (Art Bell)\n\nAs we've all come to notice, in the past few decades, Filipinos have begun to infest the United States like some sort of disease. Their extensive involvement in the U.S. Armed Forces is proof of the trashy kind of qualities all filipinos tend to exhibit on a regular basis. You can see this clearly by studying the attitudes and cultural Icons of most Filipino Americans.\n\nOrigins of Pinoys/Pinays: \n\nAre they really asian? Well we've come to accept the fact the filipinos come from a part of the world known as South East Asia. But the term ""Asia"" is used in the wrong way. You may notice that contemporary Filipino Americans try very hard to associate themselves with groups that we know as Asian. I cannot count the number of times I have seen a 'Third World' Filipino try to connect themselves to the chinese or Japanese people. There is no connection and here's why. The Philippines is a Third World country. Nothing respectable has EVER been created by Filipino people during our entire human history. Young filipino men in America have become obsessed with ""import racing"". They have an enormously perverted affection for Japanese cars. It's a common phenomenon. In their minds, these Filipinos somehow believe that they are asian and that it somehow connects them to Japanese people and japanese cars. They often take credit for the ingenuity of Japanese people and say how it's an ""Asian thing"". This term...""Asian thing"" derived directly from African American slang ""black thang"". ""It's a black thang."" ""It's an asian thang."" \n\nYou can see the connection. It's even funnier that, in Japan, Filipinos are heavily discriminated against. The only filipinos that can live successfully in Japan are the filipino prostitutes. But that's the case for most Filipino people no matter where they live in th e world. Now we've come down to this fact...and it is a fact. \n\nNothing in Filipino Culture can be seen as Asian.\n\nThey have no architectural, artistic, or cultural influence which is in ANY way, asian. Thinking of the great countries in Asia such as Japan, Korea, and China there is no way you can possibly connect the Philippine Islands. This assault by filipino americans to connect themselves with the great peoples of North East Asia is foul and disgusting. Try visiting a young filipino's web site too. \n\nYou'll see something called the ""Asian IRC Ring"". It has to do with the chatrooms. The most horrible thing about this is that these TRASHY people are trying to associate themselves with Asia again!! People in Asia don't act like this at all. What we are seeing here is the natural Filipino in its element with full access to technology and this is how they act! You will consistently see this behavior over and over again. \n\nAnother interest ing thing is that these ""thirdworld"" people also frequent RC chatrooms such as #chinese #japan and #asian. They must believe that they are somehow related racially or culturally to North Asians. But it's completely WRONG! There might have been some distant contact With China and even less with Japan during World War II, but these people are actually more closely related to african americans and Mexican americans. \n\nDo the parents of these young filipinos know what's going on? Would they accept this? I believe that they would and do. This is the natural ""Trash"" element in filipinos manifesting itself. Nothing good has ever come from Philippines and I don't believe anything good ever will. \n\nRecognizing your Roots (A Message to Filipinos). To all filipino people: \nPleas"

"3","what is milk thistle for?","","Milk thistle is used to treat inflammatory liver ailments, especially chronic illnesses, such as hepatitis and cirrhosis. Gallbladder ailments and related digestive symptoms, varicose and spider veins problems in the legs and jaundice are helped by milk thistle treatment, as well. A silymarin injection is an antidote to poisoning from the ""death cap"" mushroom, amanita.\n\nTherapeutic Effect\n      The active ingredient in milk thistle seeds is silymarin, a combination of three different flavonoids that supports the walls of liver cells, preventing poisons from penetrating them. It also stimulates the regeneration of these cells. Bitter principles and amino acids help support the entire digestive system.\n\nSilymarin as a liver tonic\n      People with acute liver problems should follow a six-week treatment with tea made from milk thistle seeds (below, in healing tea mixtures) several times a year. This tea treatment program is often recommended for people with liver damage caused by excess alcohol intake and cirrhosis.\n\nHow silymarin works\n      Silymarin helps prevent liver poisoning in two ways. It changes the liver cell walls in such a way that it is very difficult for poisons, such as cabon tetrachloride, to penetrate the walls. Silymarin also stimulates cell division so that new liver cells will grow continually.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMethods of Administration\nTea\n      For poor digestion, drink this tea 30 min. before meals. To support blood vessel integrity for the treatment of spider or varicose veins, drink 2-3 cups of tea throughout the day.\nPour 1 cup of boiling water over 2 tsps. of crushed seeds. Steep 10-15 min. and strain. There is no time limit on treatment with this tea; its use may be ongoing. \n      Peppermint increases the effectiveness of milk thistle tea and improves its taste. When you make the tea, add 1 tbsp. of peppermint leaves to the mixture.\n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nTincture\n      For gallstones or other gallbladder concerns, take 20-30 drops up to 3 times daily until the condition improves. To prepare the tincture, mix ¼ cup of crushed seeds with 1¼ cups of rum in a clean glass jar. Cover tightly and shake well. Let stand for 4-6 weeks, shaking every few days. Strain out the seeds and bottle the liquid. \n\n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nNutritional Supplement\n      To support good liver function, eat 1 tbsp. of ground seeds daily. In a coffee grinder or spice mill, grind seeds to add to hot cereals, muffins, rice dishes and other whole-grain meals. \n\n\n--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n\nMedicinal Uses\nTincture for intensive treatment\n      Silymarin is only partly water soluble, so for an intensive treatment to protect and regenerate liver cells, you should also use a tincture made from milk thistle seeds to increase the effect of the tea. Put 10 drops of the tincture into 1 cup of milk thistle tea. This tincture can also be purchased in health food stores. Caution: Because of its alcohol content, never use the tincture if you are suffering from acute liver inflammation or alcoholism.\n\nLeaf tea for aiding digestion\n      You can also make therapeutic teas from the leaves of the milk thistle. They do not contain silymarin, but they have an overall positive effect on the liver and gallbladder, and a tea made with them is valuable for improving digestion and for easing mild digestive complaints. Pour 1 cup of boiling water over 1½ tsp. of finely chopped leaves. Steep for 5-10 min. and then strain. Drink 2-3 glasses per day.\n\nCompresses for varicose veins\n      The external application of the tea in a compress can help varicose veins and open leg sores. Make the tea; cool. Soak a cloth in the cooled tea and apply as a damp compress "

"3","How can i control my sleep?","I like to sleep a lot. Sometimes i sleep for 10+ hours in a day. Some people say its not healthy. Is there any way for me to control my sleep?","Ok, without getting a full history beyond ""I sleep 10+ hours a day"", there may or may not be a health issue here. Although the ""appropriate"" amount of sleep is widely accepted to be an AVERAGE of about 8 hours; there are clearly individual differences among people in what their sleep ""need"" is.\n\nBeyond the individual differences, there are also age related need... babies will sleep much of the day, where as the elderly will need a bit less than the average adult. Children and teens will need a bit more than the average adult (although teens will often not get it due to poor sleep habits).\n\nNow, all that being said, you may indeed have a sleep disorder with 10+ hours of sleep. That is quite a bit for someone who typed at least 3 sentences with proper grammer and syntax. There are some non-respiratory (the most common sleep disorder is Obstructive Sleep Apnea) that can cause people to sleep all the time and teen years is when they tend to show up. Narcolepsy and Klein Levens comes to mind, but they are rather rare, and the cataplexy (sudden loss of muscle tone resulting in collapse) that is associated with narcolepsy isn't something that is easily overlooked. \n\nIf you find that you snore when you sleep, then obstructive sleep apnea is a possibility; indicating that you may be breathing poorly (or not at all) through the night disrupting your sleep and requiring you to stay in bed tring to catch up longer. When apneics wake up hundreds of times a night to breath, they don't actually remember it generally.\n\nAdditionally, poor sleep hygeine can add to the amount of sleep you end up trying to get. If you have a poor sleep schedule (changing get up and go to bed times often), work out close to bedtime, drink caffeine late, have TV or radio on at bedtime, read in bed, etc... then you may not be getting very good sleep, and therefore needing more sleep.\n\nNOW, with all those possiblilities thrown out, there are still more I haven't mentioned. The best thing to do is seek out a sleep disorders center in your area (they are everywhere) and get a referal from your primary care physician and have a sleep study done to determine if indeed you have a problem that may be a health risk to you. These are easy tests really, you will come into a lab before bed, they will attach a couple dozen wires to you with a little glue and you'll sleep overnight while being monitored, if narcolepsy is suspected then you may do some ""nap studies"" through the day also.

""ur experiences with God"" are also welcome.. Thanks!!  =)","Of course there is some question of, ""Why are we here?"" and the ""Meaning of life?"" I believe strongly in God. I believe he sent his son down to earth to die for my sins, your sins, and everyone sins. Jesus, bridges the gap between God and us that was separated when Adam and Eve first turn their backs on him in the Garden of Eden. Sacrificing something pure, like a lamb, then was the gap filled. But then Jesus came, a pure being, God’s only son, he was like the lamb, pure and without sin, sacrificed for our sins to fill the gap between God and us. Believing in Jesus and accepting him into our lives fill that gap to God and we have access to eternal life. \n\nGod is so significant in my life. My mother was taken from me at 12 years old by ovarian cancer. I didn’t think God cared. Later I experienced trials of my faith. I grew to learn that there is a purpose to everything and that everything happens for a reason. Everything happens for the best. \n\nOne certain case, I believe, would be that an angel of the Lord confronted me. I had had some troubles at home and I stormed off to my school. I sat there on the swing sets looking down at the ground. I noticed the school was completely empty. I cannot recall any sound of the highway that could be heard very clearly near by. Then I noticed a young woman with blonde hair. She was pushing a baby in a stroller. She had been walking around the track and soon came to the playground, which I had been the whole time. She slowly approached and asked if I was all right. Of course, I said yes, trying to shrug her off. She asked me if I knew about Jesus. I thought that she saw it was a perfect opportunity to preach about Jesus and God. I already knew all that stuff, I told her I knew him and told her my father is involved with the church. She smiled and said that that was nice. She then said something I will never forget. She said with a smile on her face, “Alright, just know that He loves you and knows that you are upset.” I smiled, thinking that she was being nice. She started walking away and she said, “Nice talking to you, Michael.” She walked away towards the surrounding school buildings. I then realized, I never mentioned my name. I didn’t even know her. In a small community, I had never seen her before. I then got on my bike and rode to the building to talk again with her. She had gone past the building very shortly before I arrived there on my bike. I turned the corner and she wasn’t there. It was physically impossible to get out of the school that fast, especially with a baby. I was then filled with a great sense of power and strength. It was a great feeling. I rode my bike home faster than ever. I was crying all the way home.\n\nI have told this story to only a few people. I never expected people to believe me; I could care less if they didn’t. I believe what happened. I was there. That helped incidence helped me so much. I felt much better after that. Today, I still have problems. I am human. But I can always turn to Jesus for help. I believe in him by Faith, and Faith alone. That is all you need to attain salvation! Faith.\n\nI hope you understand to that God loves you. \n             God Bless You!\n                  Michael DeCourcy"

How the heck did that happen?","This was on discovery channel, incidentally, when I chanced upon your question.\n\nIn the past as cavemen, the Chinese people had discovered rice for quite a while, using various ways to cook rice or meat, such as hollow bamboo, mud, and leaves.\nWhen it was hot, they probably used sticks: two sticks like a pair of tongs to hold the packet or the bamboo together.\nSlowly, it evolved from sticks, to wood, and as the Chinese flourished into a civilisation, it was decorated with laquer, made from jade, carved from Ivory, and it's uses increased from just being a tool to pick up food, to being used in quick cooking like stir-frying, to picking scraps of food off the plates, to even cutting chunks of food at the table or in the wok through a skillful manipulation of the fingers and wrists.\nThis ubiquitous tool spread to Korea, Japan and to many parts of Asia where the Chinese migrated, and brought their culture along with them."

"2","seismograph?","","The simplest explanation:\n\nA seismograph is just basically a pen on a spring (although now days this is replaced by a sensor) It measures ground motion. Earthquakes, nuclear weapons tests, the impact of waves striking the coast, the rumble of trucks on a highway, volcanoes and many other things can result in ground motion that a seismograph can measure. Seismologists looking for oil can use vibrating trucks or underground explosions to send waves into the ground that seismographs can measure, and turn into pictures of what the earth looks like underground.  \n\nOf course, this can get far more complicated. Some seismographs can measure lower frequencies, even using superconductivity, etc. Seismographs really measure ground acceleration, which is the second derivative of ground displacement."

"2","What is antimatter?","when an electron and its anti particle meet  what happens to the mass? does it disappear? wouldnt that violate the law of conservation of matter?","Antimatter or contra-terrene matter is matter that is composed of the antiparticles of those that constitute normal matter. If a particle and its antiparticle come in contact with each other, the two annihilate and produce a burst of energy, which results in the production of other particles and antiparticles or electromagnetic radiation. In these reactions, rest mass is not conserved, although (as in any other reaction) energy (E=mc²) is conserved.\n\n\nIn 1928 Paul Dirac developed a relativistic equation for the electron, now known as the Dirac equation. Curiously, the equation was found to have negative energy solutions in addition to the normal positive ones. This presented a problem, as electrons tend toward the lowest possible energy level; energies of negative infinity are nonsensical. As a way of getting around this, Dirac proposed that the vacuum can be considered a ""sea"" of negative energy, the Dirac sea. Any electrons would therefore have to sit on top of the sea.\n\nThinking further, Dirac found that a ""hole"" in the sea would have a positive charge. At first he thought that this was the proton, but Hermann Weyl pointed out the hole should have the same mass as the electron. The existence of this particle, the positron, was confirmed experimentally in 1932 by Carl D. Anderson.\n\nToday's standard model shows that every particle has an antiparticle, for which each additive quantum number has the negative of the value it has for the normal matter particle. The sign reversal applies only to quantum numbers (properties) which are additive, such as charge, but not to mass, for example. The positron has the opposite charge but the same mass as the electron. An atom of antihydrogen is composed of a negatively-charged antiproton being orbited by a positively-charged positron .\nNotation\nPhysicists need a notation to distinguish particles from antiparticles. One way is to denote an antiparticle by adding a bar (or macron) over the symbol for the particle. For example, the proton and antiproton are denoted as  and , respectively.\n\nAnother convention is to distinguish particles by their electric charge. Thus, the electron and positron are denoted simply as e− and e+. Adding a bar over the e+ symbol would be redundant and is not done.\n\nAntimatter as fuel\nIn antimatter-matter collisions, the entire rest mass of the particles is converted to energy. The energy per unit mass is about 10 orders of magnitude greater than chemical energy, and about 2 orders of magnitude greater than nuclear energy that can be liberated today using chemical reactions or nuclear fission/fusion. The reaction of 1 kg of antimatter with 1 kg of matter would produce 1.8×1017 J (180 petajoules) of energy (by the equation E=mc²). In contrast, burning a kilogram of gasoline produces 4.2×107 J, and nuclear fusion of a kilogram of hydrogen would produce 2.6×1015 J. Not all of that energy can be utilized by any realistic technology, because as much as 50% of energy produced in reactions between nucleons and antinucleons is carried away by neutrinos, so, for all intents and purposes, it can be considered lost.[2]\n\nThe scarcity of antimatter means that it is not readily available to be used as fuel, although it could be used in antimatter catalyzed nuclear pulse propulsion. Generating a single antiproton is immensely difficult and requires particle accelerators and vast amounts of energy—millions of times more than is released after it is annihilated with ordinary matter, due to inefficiencies in the process. Known methods of producing antimatter from energy also produce an equal amount of normal matter, so the theoretical limit is that half of the input energy is converted to antimatter. Counterbalancing this, when antimatter annihilates with ordinary matter, energy equal to twice the mass of the antimatter is liberated—so energy storage in the form of antimatter could (in theory) be 100% efficient.

Originally based in Orlando, Florida, they are now based in Kissimmee, Florida, a suburb south of Orlando in Osceola County. The ownership group of the Seals is led by David Waronker.\n\nThe team was formed as the Orlando Seals, and played its first season beginning in October 2002 with the Atlantic Coast Hockey League (ACHL). It was the winner of that league's first and only President's Cup in 2003. When the ACHL folded, they and two other teams, the Jacksonville Barracudas and the Macon Trax, merged into the new World Hockey Association 2 (WHA2), founded by Waronker himself. After the 2003-2004 season, the World Hockey Association served a cease-and-desist order on the WHA2 and it merged with the South East Hockey League (SEHL) to form the Southern Professional Hockey League (SPHL).\n\nThe Orlando Seals were scheduled to play in the 2004-2005 SPHL season, but on August 22, 2004, the City of Orlando revoked its lease at the TD Waterhouse Centre, causing them to miss the season. On October 19, 2004, the ownership group announced a new three-year lease with the Silver Spurs Arena in Kissimmee. The team resumed play in the 2005-2006 season, hosting their first home game against the Jacksonville Barracudas on October 29, 2005.\n\nThe mascot of the Florida Seals is Sealvester. He wears a jersey emblazoned with the number ""02""."
"2","Why are more people right-handed than left-handed?","","No one knows for certain why the human population is right-handed-dominant, but a number of theories have been proposed.\n\nBrain hemisphere division of labor is the most commonly accepted theory of handedness. The premise of this theory is that since both speaking and handiwork require fine motor skills, having one hemisphere of the brain do both would be more efficient than having it divided up. And since in most people, the left side of the brain controls speaking, right-handedness would prevail. It also predicts that left-handed people would have a reversed brain division of labor. Lastly, since other primates do not have a spoken language (at least of the type we have) there would be no stimulus for right-handed preference among them, and that is true.\n\nObjections to this theory claim that it does not explain why the left hemisphere would always be the one controlling language. Why not 50% of the population left and 50% right? While 95% of right-handers do indeed use the left side of the brain for speaking, it is more variable for left-handers. Some do use the right for linguistic skills, some use the left hemisphere, and others use both. On the balance, it appears that this theory could well explain some left-handedness, but it has too many gaps to explain all left-handedness.\n\nThere are more than genetics involved in determining if a person is right- or left-handed Even when both parents are left-handed, there is only a 26% chance of their child being left-handed. Thus, it is clear that genetics is not the only cause. Handedness must also be influenced by some other causes.\n\nBirth stress is theory that states disturbs certain left-handed people, because its basic premise is that left-handedness is due to brain damage during the birth process. Nevertheless, some statistics do back this theory up.\n\nParental pressure theory explains right-handed dominance by claiming that since the parents who raised us are mostly right-handed, we came to be mostly right-handed and so on."

This is similar to the historical development of astronomy from astrology, and that of chemistry from alchemy."

Someone has to be supporting her, paying her house note or rent, putting food in her mouth, printing those tshirts and banners and signs, putting gas in her car, paying her insurance.....Where is all that money coming from?  She's not going to a job everyday, so where's the money source?  Who is the money source?  What terrorist group is paying her to harass the US government?\n\nDon't forget that her son was killed AFTER he RE-enlisted.  He would be angry over her actions.  He believed he was doing good."
"7","why Abhyudaya  with >5000 points not featured in top 5?","","Hi Rams,\nThanks for the concern. I had asked the question before to Yahoo! Answers Team & I got the answer that most of my questions were identical. It might have happened because, I asked most of them with a format like - ""A Riddle"", ""Another Riddle"" & ""Yet another Riddle"" etc. So, they might have diagnosed that all these questions are identical which they were not.\nAlso, another reason might be that most of my questions were in the ""Jokes & Riddles"" sub-category & thus, were not ""Knowledge-based"". I am now trying to ask diverse questions to get into the leaderboard. \nThanks & Take Care"
"5","diffrence between hardwired & microprogrammed control?","computer organisation & architecture","Hardwired systems are made to perform in a set manner, implemented with logic, switches, etc. between any input and output in the system. Once the manner in which the control is executed, you can not change the behavior of the system.\n\nMicroprogrammed systems are centered around a computer of some sort, often a microcontroller in small systems, that controls the system using a program. Input is sent to the computer, and the program determines what should be done with the input to come up with an output. So the processor is between the input and the output, rather than a direct link between the input and output.\n\nThe vesatility of the microprogrammed system far exceeds the hardwired system. The systems can also be considerably smaller. The size of a complex microcontroller can be quite a bit smaller that a bunch of logic and switches for the same functionality.\n\nThis what you were looking for?"
"7","do you have ashtrays out , even if you don't smoke?","","The only ashtrays I have out are outside, No smoking in my house. I am a smoker, but don't want my children exposed to the second hand smoke.

Or ""N.B.""?","I haven't seen it in anything published in English for a while...","I'm an Undergrad Lit. student and, to be honest, every single one of my professors uses either Nota Bene or NB.  Some use both, which is rather redundant, but alas, they have doctorates, and I don't. Over the last 3 years, I'm simply accepted it.  So yes, people still do use the term.  Granted, this is scholarly writing, but it's still writing.  And English is based on Latin, to some degree, so by using Latin in English writing, you're speaking English."

If your housing office doesn't do this, see if you have an office of commuter students or adult students that is for students who live off campus and chances are they will have some type of roommate list.\n\nAlso, you can list an email address to respond to, although I'm not sure as many people will respond to an email as to a phone number. Get a non-crazy sounding Yahoo email account name just for this process and then cancel the account when you have a roommate. \n\nHope this helps."
"2","does hot water dry faster then cold water?","","yes, it does.  \n\nhere's how evaporation works: the molecules of the water are bouncing around and colliding with each other, randomly changing direction and speed all the time.  when one molecule near the surface randomly gets a kick towards the surface (if it's moving fast enough to overcome the strength of hydrogen bonding) it will exit the condensed water and literally come shooting out of the liquid and into the air.  \n\nthe reverse process (condensation) happens at the same time - water molecules in the atmosphere will randomly go shooting into the surface of the liquid, where they are captured by water's hydrogen bonds.  if the air is humid enough, this will happen at the same rate as evaporation and the result will be called a dynamic equilibrium - water is evaporating and condensing in equal amounts and the water level will appear static.\n\nanyway, if you turn the temperature of the water up, the molecules move faster.  this is how we interpret the meaning of temperature on the microscopic level.  so, faster-moving molecules are more likely to overcome the hydrogen bonding, and therefore more often escape the water's surface, which results in faster evaporation."

What kind of reason is to band CNN because they mistakenly said that Mahmoud Ahmadinejad wanted Nuclear Weapons. And knowing that I'm from Iran, no they don't want nuclear weapons. But CNN made a mistake, and it is no reason to be banned. Iran has turned to a very strict country after the revolution 27 years ago. Since the revolution, people can't wear shorts, t-shirts, sandals, or anything. Women have to have their head covered. And must be always be covered. \nSince Mahmoud Ahmadinejad became president, he has banned music. I read recently that bands have moved in the basement, and that they must play illigally."

"7","How dooes everybody feel about legalizing WEED?","","Marijuana is an extremely useful plant that should be cultivated legally. The drug aspect of it should be decriminalized and treated as cigarettes and  alcohol are, with age limits and extreme taxation. We could pull this country half way out of debt simply by taxing the marijuana market. The effects of the drug are no more imparing than that of alcohol and the idea that this is a gateway to harsher drugs is ridiculous. If it were as legal as alcohol and cigarettes, it would be no more a ""gateway"" to smoking or injesting illegal things than they are also. Our tax dollars are better spent enforcing and punishing violent crimes and not looking for a college kids smoking a joint."

"2","How does a streams velocity affect erosion?","","the faster the streams velocity is, the quicker the erosion takes place.  this is caused by increased friction as velocity increases.\n\nit's sort of like falling from a plane.  you go faster and faster, and as your velocity increases, so does the friction.  soon, you'll hit terminal velocity, or the point where you are no longer accelerating.  the force of friction with the air eventually will equal out with the force of you falling, but still, as you get going faster there is more friction.\n\nthis friction causes the erosion and so the faster the velocity the more the rocks, soil, etc. erodes."

"4","is a window a viscous fluid?","","The answer to that is ""no."" The old ""glass is a slow moving liquid"" bit is an old wives tale. Or in this case, an old professors tale.\n\nThe essential reason is that in a fluid all the molecules are disordered and only loosely bound. While in glass the molecues are strongly bound, although disordered. \n\nThere is some wiggle room in the definition of solid and liquid, but it probably doesn't matter in this instance. The main evidence for glass being a liquid is the claim that glass in, say, old buildings has slowly settled and made the bottom thinker has never been shown to be due to glass being a liquid. In fact, the existence of perfectly fine glass from the time of the Roman Empire makes it unlikely.\n\nThe second link I've included is an extensive discussion of the whole ""windows are flowing down"" bit - the conclusion being, that it is more likely the panes were made with uneven thickness and the glass was inserted with the thicker end down - which  is the logical thing to do in that circumstance."

Man, can learn well anything, but true knowledge only comes from applying the teachings to an application.  Harvard only teaches words, not with spirit.  When men learn using the holy spirit of God, the Holy Ghost testifies to him of the truthfulness of those words. One must be living and serving those words in order to have his spirit with them.","I notice that you didn't say you went to Harvard or have a degree in Theology - you didn't say who, though there have been many....\n\nIt's probably the business of religion.

"7","how to know whether someone loves u or not?what is true love? and how can one know whether they r in true love","","Last question first: and how can one know whether they r in true love \n\nBeing ""in love"" is like an orgasm--when it happens you'll know.  If you're not sure it's probably some similar features but not the real thing.  If by ""true love"" you mean the love that's deeper than an exciting infatuation, then you can tell that by the feelings that come in as the excitement ebbs.  If the excitement dies down and you feel empty, used, bored, disinterested, then ""true love"" isn't on the way and you can't force it.  If comfort and satisfaction fill in as excitement ebbs, then you've got a keeper.  That kind of true love is so good for me I don't miss the excitement that much (I've been married forever).  It sounds weird, but it really does feel deep, like a river, while infatuation feels like a rushing mountain stream.  If you're willing to give up the pleasures of the stream for the pleasures of the river, I'd say that's true love.  It might sound like a bad trade-off, but with the right person it feels like a natural change, not a loss.  I know I thank my lucky stars every day for getting to the point we're at now.\n\n\n>how to know whether someone loves u or not?\n\nIf the other person is hiding it and doing a good job, you may never know.  If the other person is faking it I don't think they could pull it off for long unless they're a psychopath or something, in which case there would be other symptoms like excessive controlling and maybe abuse.  Between total faking and total compatibility there's lots of room for innocent ignorance and ineptitude.  If I had to pick one acid test I guess it would be how the other person handles situations where not everybody's needs get met.  For a love relationship to work, both people have to graciously put themselves second a reasonable percentage of the time.  That doesn't mean being a doormat, but it does mean thinking beyond themselves.  Someone who can't do that, or won't learn how, isn't capable of loving someone, even if they have strong feelings that they call ""love""."
"4","Why is it that so many people who post a question or answer cannot put together a simple sentence?","Is the education system in America so bad or do people that post here just not care about whether their spelling or grammar is correct?","Alot of it has to do with the shorthand used for text messages and IMing. Because of the rapidness of the conversation a generally accepted form of shorthand developed to increase the rate of conversation. If you could look at the people who demonstrate these forms of bad grammar on message boards like this one, I would be willing to bet they are high school/early college aged who grew up conversing on the computer. To them the commonly accepted rules of syntax are loosened for convience. Therefore they are following a commonly agreed upon set of rules, which in a way make this a unique language while derived from english, follow different rules. Check out the source for examples."

"5","who invented the internet?","","No one person invented the Internet as we know it today. However, certain major figures contributed major breakthroughs:\n\n(1) Leonard Kleinrock was the first to publish a paper about the idea of packet switching, which is essential to the Internet. He did so in 1961. \n\n(2) J.C.R. Licklider was the first to describe an Internet-like worldwide network of computers, in 1962. He called it the ""Galactic Network.""\n\n(3) Larry G. Roberts created the first functioning long-distance computer networks in 1965 and designed the Advanced Research Projects Agency Network (ARPANET), the seed from which the modern Internet grew, in 1966.\n\n(4) Bob Kahn and Vint Cerf invented the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) which moves data on the modern Internet, in 1972 and 1973.\n\n(5) By 1983, TCP was the standard and ARPANET began to resemble the modern Internet in many respects. The ARPANET itself was taken out of commission in 1990. Most restrictions on commercial Internet traffic ended in 1991, with the last limitations removed in 1995. NCSA Mosaic web browser also came out in 1993, the first browser that supported both text and graphics.\n\nFor an excellent article on history and evolution of the Internet, refer to the following links:\nhttp://www.isoc.org/internet/history/\nhttp://www.isoc.org/internet/history/brief.shtml\n\nOn the lighter side, as popularly said, 'Al Gore' invented the internet.

"2","Where do enzymes come from and what are their purpose?","","If you removed enzymes from the body, it would stop working and die! Enzymes are responsible for the functions of every organ. The body is a big efficient chemical factory and enzymes are needed for every chemical action and reaction.\n\nEvery gene's program is associated with the actions of enzymes. Even vitamins and nutrients can't be used effectively without enzymes.\n\nThe immune system's function is to fight off all foreign invaders in the body such as bacteria, viruses, carcinogens and other chemicals. It relies almost totally on enzymes to do its job. A weakened immune system has a diminished volume of enzymes which includes those that are defective or worn out. Enzymes have a limited life and must be replaced regularly.\n\nWhere do we get enzymes? Nine basic enzymes come from food, and the body takes these and changes them into over 3,000 varieties for various purposes."
"10","How does the Federal Deficit affect the economy?","The U.S. national debt is huge yet the economy is still fairly stable. Is there a point where the debt causes the economy to come crashing down?","Yes, but no one knows where that point is.\n\nGovernment debt increases the cost of capital.  Capital is bought and sold like any other commodity.  When you buy capital, the transaction is called a ""loan"" or ""mortgage.""  Government debt reduces the supply of capital and thus increases the cost (interest rate) of borrowing money.  This inhibits business by making it harder for businesses and individuals to borrow money.\n\nIf government debt becomes too large, business comes to a standstill and the economy would be in danger of collapsing.  No one thinks that the US economy is in danger of standing still or collapsing from government debt."

"7","how can I get old of two million dollars?","working does not get me there; investing ? I have lost 1 million, so far, in the market.  So, HOW can I get to have 2 millions?","if you invest in the stock market try having a very broad portfolio. have stocks from large cap(5 bil and up) mid cap (1-5 bil) and small cap(under 1 bil). also dont get all stocks from one market like compuer reasearch try to have a variety of companys in case one industry fails or does poorly(aircraft). If your really bad get a broker to handle your money. you will not get money instantly. that is how you lose money. hold on to stocks for 5-10 years and it will payoff you will not get rich overnight. mabey try investing in mutual funds. where a group of people pool their money and buy lots of companys so even if some companys fail you still make money. im 17 and invested 5000 in a mutual fund and in one year I have 7000. with a 10 year projected value of 25000. so dont jump to decisions and reasearch a company enough so in 1 min you could explain to a 5 year old why you are investing in that company. look at companys competetors."

"7","What is the best way to reduce credit card debt?","","Negotiate with the creditor to lower your interest and ask for forgiveness of late fees etc that they might have charged.\n\nI have had late fees forgive a couple of times just for the asking.  \n\nNegotiate with every credit card you have, once you get a card witht he lowest interest transfer all balance to that card or as much as you can into that card.\n\nPay the card with highest interest rate first.  As soon as you pay it off, cut that card off and thrwo it in the trash.  RINSE and REPEAT\n\nAt the end you will have one credit card left and pay that off.\n\nAll this while you MUST refrain from using credit again or else it will not work.  Cash your paycheck and use cash/debit card for all your expenses.\n\nMake a list of things you purchase every month and find out where you can cut cost.  Don't goto movies for a year, dont eat out, buy generic groceries, skip vacation and take double pay.  \n\nThe best is use your tax refund to pay off your debt.  Since you are used to living without that money as soon as you get your refund before you spend it pay it all into your highest interest credit card.\n\nGood luck."

Cities are clearly distinct from surrounding countryside, and that's true even from the higher perch of the International Space Station, which circles the planet at about 250 miles (400 kilometers) up. \n\nFull Story at: http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/visible_from_space_031006.html"

It engages kids into using their imaginations more. It takes adults back to their younger years with the fantasy of it all. It's a good series that keeps growing and developing. Even though we've know from the begining that there would be only 7 books and ultimately a showdown between Harry & Voldemort, it's still interesting to see the unexpected twists and turns on the way to the end. It's just a GREAT series!"

"5","how do i install the wireless interent on my notebook?","","How to Install a Wireless Network by CNET\n\nStep 1:\nGetting started\nA broadband connection brings the Internet into your home at blazing speeds. And with a wireless, or Wi-Fi, network, you can get that access on multiple computers throughout your home--and even outside it--without cords. What's more, today's wireless-networking products make broadband Internet sharing easy, inexpensive, and secure. In this Weekend Project, we'll show you how to distribute broadband Internet access among multiple notebook or desktop systems, and we'll walk you through the necessary steps to keep your network protected.\n\nThe core of a Wi-Fi network is a wireless router or gateway. We used the D-Link DI-624 AirPlus Xtreme G 802.11g router, which sells for $99 before a $20 rebate. You'll also need a wireless adapter for each system that connects to the network. We installed two D-Link AirPlus Xtreme G 802.11g wireless adapters: a DWL-G650 PC Card adapter for a Windows 2000 notebook PC ($65 before a $10 rebate) and a DWL-G520 PCI adapter for a secondary desktop running Windows XP Home Edition ($69 before a $10 rebate). The primary PC, connected to the router via an Ethernet cable, was running Windows XP Professional.\n\nStep 2:\nWhat you'll need\nBefore you get started with this project, we recommend that you have the following:\n\n* A wireless router\n* Wireless adapters and/or a wireless-enabled system or laptop\n* A broadband connection to the Internet (typically via cable or DSL modem)\n* An Ethernet cable\n* Pen and paper to write down current network settings, such as IP and MAC addresses\n\n* The IP address assigned to your system by your ISP if you use a static IP address\n* If you use DSL, the username and password assigned to you by your ISP\n* The MAC address for all wireless network adapters\n\nStep 3:\nPrepare for installation\nYou may need a few bits of information to set up your router correctly. Double-click the Network Connections icon within Control Panel and right-click the icon for your PC's Ethernet adapter. Then choose Properties > Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) > Properties. If ""Use the following IP address"" is highlighted, your Internet access uses a static IP address. Jot down the IP address, the subnet mask, and the default gateway. Then click ""Obtain an IP address automatically."" Click OK to apply your changes and OK again to close the dialog.\n\nYou'll find your Ethernet adapter's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway within its Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.\nYou'll find your Ethernet adapter's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway within its Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.\nYou'll find your Ethernet adapter's IP address, subnet mask, and default gateway within its Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) Properties.\n\nIf you have a DSL connection, you'll probably need the username and the password your system requires to connect to your ISP. If you don't know the values, try looking within the software your ISP provided. You may need to uninstall the PPPoE connection software that your ISP provided. To find out, check your router's documentation.\n\nNow is also a good time to collect the MAC addresses of any wireless-network adapters you'll be installing. The MAC address should be printed on the Wi-Fi PC Card or the PCI adapter.\n\nStep 4:\nInstall the router\n\nConnect your modem to the WAN port on the router and your PC to an open Ethernet port on the router.\nConnect your modem to the WAN port on the router and your PC to an open Ethernet port on the router.\n\nMost DSL users will probably need to choose a PPPoE connection type.\nMost DSL users will probably need to choose a PPPoE connection type.\nBefore you install the router, power down your PC and modem, then disconnect the Ethernet cable from your PC and connect it to your router's WAN port so that the Ethernet cable connects the modem to the route"

"3","What is Carbuncle ?","","carbuncle \n\nAs a medical term\nA ]] larger than a boil, usually with one or more openings draining pus onto the skin. It is usually caused by bacterial infection.\n\n\nIn gemology\nA carbuncle is a term for a convex, unfaceted, deep-red garnet.\n\n\nIn the Bible\nThe word carbuncle occurs in three places in most translations of the Bible. Each use originates from the same Hebrew word בָּרְקַת בָּרְקַת or bâreqath bâreqath (baw-reh'-keth, baw-rek-ath'). In this sense, a carbuncle is usually taken to mean a gem, particularly a deep-red garnet, unfaceted and convex; however, the Hebrew definition is less definite and the precise color of the gems is not known."
"3","i am 89 lbs and i feel fat and look fat i am 16 years old why do i feel fat am i fat or what?","","If you're of average height for your age, you're not fat. You're probably in very nice shape!\n\nHowever, what other people think or tell you won't change your mental image.  Part of what makes you feel that way is that your body is changing from that of a girl to that of a woman.  You're getting curves in all the right places, and developing a figure.  It's a great thing, but it may take time to get comfortable with getting, like..old, gurl ;-)\n\nIf your weight is becoming an obsession, where you feel that you have to lose weight to look ""good"", then you should probably talk to an adult about it.  If you don't feel that you can talk to your parents, then maybe an adult friend, a school counselor...  If the feeling continues, it can lead to anorexia, bulimia, and all the complications that result from those - even death."

Water from rivers and streams may look clean, but they are not.\n\nWater can be purified by several ways:\n- Filtering. Like the Brita or PuR water filters. Water goes through the filters while bacteria, dirt, and some chemicals get trapped in the filter.\n- Boiling. It kills most of the bacteria which can make you sick, but does not remove dirt or chemicals.\n- Distilling. Similar to boiling, but you take the steam from boiling water and turn it back into water. Best form of purification in my opinion, but takes a long time and requires special equipment.\n- Chemical purification. Used by the military. You add a chemical to the water. This chemical kills the bacteria and makes the other chemicals in the water harmless. The water may be safe to drink, but it will taste awful."

They stimulate the gum tissue and toughen it against periodontal disease, and they are also excellent for removing food particles. Try it- brush your teeth, then use a water pick. You'll see the food it dislodges. One tip- when you first begin, use a very gentle setting, or else you can cause gum injury/bleeding. As your gums strengthen, you can increase the pressure."

"4","How would you rate Cooley Law Scool in Lansing, Michigan?  How tough is it to succeed at this school?","","Overall, I think Cooley is a good law school.  The obvious draw back is that it doesn't have much national recognition or prestige, which translates to difficulty in obtaining certain types of legal employment (by which I mean the kinds of jobs that pay good salaries).  This is pretty easy to see if you compare the average starting salary of a Cooley grad to those of schools in other tiers.  \n\nThat said, I think the quality of education you can get at Cooley is on par with any law school in the country.  While they don't have the big name professors at the fore front of their fields, I found all of the professors I had to be very capable educators, and truly concerned with helping us to understand the law.\n\nIt is difficult to say how tough it is to succeed at Cooley.  I worked very hard, got a 4.0 my first semester, a 3.9 my second semester (15 hours each semester) and transferred to an Ivy League law school.  In my mind, anything less wouldn't have been successful, but other people were thrilled to have above a B average.\n\nOne thing that is certainly true at Cooley is that there isn't any grade inflation.  While an average GPA at top schools might be 3.4, I calculated the average GPA in my section at Cooley to be around 2.2 - more than a full point lower.  But that is a little misleading, too.  While the curve is lower, due to the admission requirements, there are also a lot more people at Cooley that in all honesty aren't competing for the top grades.\n\nIn sum, I would say that purely from an educational standpoint, Cooley is a great school.  When it comes to getting a job, especially in medium to large law firms, Cooley is subpar.  If that is your (husband's) goal, it is very important to work harder than he thinks he needs to, and get the very best grades, and transfer to the highest ranked school possible.  It's sad that it has to be that way, but it is.\n\nGood Luck!"

"2","how does the telegraph sending morse code make sound?","","If you're talking strictly telegraph, then it's just the tapping of metal on metal.\n\nEvery time the sender presses the key down, he closes an electrical circuit and when he releases the key, it breaks the circuit. It's similar to flipping the light switch on and off.\n\nIf the sender's key is down, it sends electricity through the telegraph wires to the receiver. The electricity energizes an electric-magnet, which pulls down a small hammer on the receiver's side. This results in a ""tap"" sound. When the sender releases the key, the electricity is shut off, cutting power to the electric-magnet. A spring then pulls the hammer back up to its starting position where it's ready to tap again when the sender presses the key."

"2","What do tha crystal sizes of granite and basalt tell you about where they formed?","","The larger crystals in granite tell us that it formed deep underground.  Geologists call such rocks intrusive igneous rocks.  Insulated from the coolness of earth's surface, the molten rock (magma--molten rock underground) cooled slowly and the crystals had time to grow large.  Basalt flowed onto earth's surface as molten rock (lava--molten rock on earth's surface) and there it cooled quickly, so the crystals had little time to grow.  Geologists call such rocks extrusive igneous rocks.\n\nThere are other differences between granites and basalts, but I think speed of cooling, related to where the molten rock cooled, answers your question."

Do churchs hold mass (or communion, etc.) on other days of the week also?","I think the kind of christians he is refering to are those who are born in a country where christianity is the state relgion and you are automatically born as a christian like Finland etc. So there you will find many people who are regestered as christians but who are actually athiests or only visit the church when its for their own convenience or when there is some special function like christmas etc. Also these kinds of christians like to visit churches only on sunday to confess their sins because they feel guilty for all the shameful activities they have done during the past week.\n\nIn every religion you will find sincere followers and those who follow just for the sake of following.

When he dies does god send him to hell for not believing in him? \n\nIf so how can god be considered infinitely good if he sends this man, and billions of others like him to burn in the depths of hell even when they have lived good lives.","God says that he is a merciful God. To answer your question I would say ""NO"". God knows there are people out there who haven't heard of him. God sees every human's heart and mind and knows what kind of person they are. God reserves judgment unto himself. But another question is--what is hell? The Greek word Hades referrs to a hole in the ground where all man goes when he dies. The burning hell you are referring to is the Lake of Fire where those who have received God's judgment go. All mankind have to stand before God Almighty when it's their time. God opens the book of life and the rewards He has written in there are given to the people whose names are written in His book."

"2","how long is a light year?","","In one year there are 365 days of 24 hours. Each hour has 60 minutes and each minute is 60 seconds long. So, 60s/min x 60min/hr x 24hr/day x 365days equals 31,536,000s. This many seconds is an even larger number than the number of miles light goes in one second! It would take you three years to get to number 31,536,000 if you could write one number per second for eight hours per day. This many miles means you could go back and forth across the United States over one thousand times! At 60 miles per hour it would take you 60 years! \n\nSo, we take these two very large numbers and multiply them together to see how many miles light can travel in one year. You can tell already that this is going to be huge! That number is 5,865,696,000,000. Working eight hours per day at a rate of one number per second it would take you two hundred thousand years to get to number 5,865,696,000,000! This gets you across the United States two billion times which at our average speed of 60 miles per hour, would take nine trillion years! \n\nNow that you know what the distance is that light travels in one year you can also know the distance between objects in the universe. The closest star to us is about four light years away. This means that it is 23,462,784,000,000 miles away. How about this: the edge of the universe is about 15 billion light years away from us! Can you even imagine how many miles away that is?"

"5","How do computers keep record of time even when they are Shut Down ?","","computers store this information in a CMOS chip that uses a small battery to retain the information when the computer is shut off. \n\nCMOS (complementary metal oxide semiconductor) is type of chip that consumes very little power; therefore, while the computer is turned off, the battery discharges very slowly. But the battery will totally discharge if you leave your computer turned off for a year or so. Even if you turn your computer on every day, the battery is designed to last only a couple of years. Occasionally a battery will fail prematurely. \n\nToday’s plug-and-play computers can detect most of the necessary settings, but if your CMOS battery is dead, your computer will not be able to retain the date and time. The computer will also lose any custom settings, for example, the boot sequence. If you set a password in CMOS, you may be locked out of the computer. If the CMOS battery does fail, you might receive the message ""System Configuration Lost"" when you start the computer. It would be wise to record all the CMOS settings as a precaution. \n\nTo record the CMOS settings, watch for an on-screen prompt when you first start your computer. The prompt tells you to press a key, usually the Del or F2, to enter CMOS. To enter the CMOS configuration utility, you have to press the indicated key while the message is on the screen. After the CMOS configuration screen appears, follow the instructions provided to page through all the screens and record all the settings. \n\nIf your computer loses its time setting overnight, the CMOS battery may not be holding a charge. The CMOS battery is located inside the case on the motherboard. Changing the battery is usually a job for a computer technician. In fact, a layman might not even be able to find the battery. \n\nIf you want to locate the CMOS battery in your computer, be aware that a static discharge from your hands can damage components inside the case. After taking proper precautions, open the case and look on the motherboard for a battery. If you have a diagram of your motherboard, locate the battery on the diagram first. \n\nDifferent motherboards use different types of batteries. The battery may be shaped like a barrel or a coin. Some motherboards use a component that resembles a chip which contains the CMOS and the battery (made by DALLAS or Benchmarq). Batteries come in different voltages, so make sure you get an exact replacement. \n\nSometimes the battery is mounted in a holder. Sometimes it is soldered to the motherboard. De-soldering and re-soldering a battery is usually a job for a computer technician. An inexperienced solderer can cause a lot of damage. If you want to try to do it yourself, first practice on an obsolete circuit board. You may change your mind. \n\nIf the CMOS battery has failed because it’s too old, this might be an opportunity to upgrade your motherboard. When upgrading a motherboard, the most important considerations are to make sure the new motherboard is the correct form factor for your case, and that the new motherboard has the correct bus connector slots for your expansion boards."

Keep the passion while you are away by writing to her everyday, calling her, sending flowers works the best and say you are thinking of her.

Now, before I go any further, I should make clear that I'm not talking about any of the gods defined in various religions. Throughout all of human history, we've been trying to explain existence. But nobody has ever succeeded. And it's likely that nobody ever will. So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though. It doesn't mean that any particular religion is correct. It merely defines god as something which answers The Question, because we have not been able to."
"1","What paths does God want women to have?","","Woman have a higher calling than men, according to Jesus, and that is to serve. We men have been chosen to be the leader--but that is not the greatest calling. If you noticed, it was the women who received the greatest honors while Jesus was on earth. Look at Mary and annointing Jesus' feet, and how Jesus honored that act. It was the women who FIRST saw the risen Lord. Why? Because they were in the process of serving at the time--to annoint the body of the ""dead"".

So many people directly associate sex with love and assume you have to be in love with someone to have good sex with them.  Personally, I think that sex is one of the most fun things a person can do and I'm sure most people agree.  I also think that it is very personal and I'm not into sleeping with just anyone.  But I think that sex between 2 (or more) people that get along and have a good time together but are not in love, is perfectly fine.  I also think that it is a natural desire for most people to be want to have sex with more than just the one person you are in love with, especially people who are comfortable with sex.  My boyfriend and I have tried swinging with other couples and we have enjoyed it.  We both trust each other and know that it is just about having fun.  Plus, I feel more confident that my boyfriend isn't going to cheat on me because he has an outlet for his natural feelings to be with other women.  Just my opinion!"

In short the initial meaning of this clause was that the congress had the power to enact what was required to enforce its delegated powers, that is, the new laws would be necessary to enforce powers which had been properly delegated to the federal government.  \n\nFrom 1801 to 1835 the Supreme Court of the United States fell under the sway of Chief Justice John Marshall who believe in a very strong general government as did Alexander Hamilton.  Marshall opined (in part) in McCulloch v. Maryland [1819] that the words of Article I, Section 8, Clause 18 “Necessary” and “Proper” had the same meaning.  Therefore laying the foundation for the Congress to enact any law they believed to be necessary.  Both Madison and Jefferson disagreed with this court decision, but it has stood as precedence for ensuing cases to use it to strengthen the position of the federal government.  From this perspective the “Elastic” was stretched out of all shape relative to original intent."

"2","1. Why is mitosis a form of asexual reproduction?","","Mitosis  is the method used for cell division and reproduction in cells not involved in sexual reproduction. This process starts with one replication (copying of the chromosome material) and one division of the chromosome material.   This results in the chromosome numbers in the two cells produced being the same as in the parent cell. Sexual involves getting genetic material from 2 parent cells.Mitosis  is associated with asexual reproduction, as well as growth and repair in sexually reproducing organisms. The offspring of mitosis are clones of the parent cell."

"2","How do blood types combine?","Can someone with A+ blood type and someone with A- blood type, produce a child with B- type or O- type?","Two people with type A blood cannot produce a child with type B blood, but they can produce a child with type O blood.\n\nIn blood type, A and B are co-dominant, and O is recessive.  You inherit a gene from each of your parents, and they must both be O in order for you to have type O blood.  The same is not true with A and B.  Those types show themselves if you only inherit one gene for either one.\n\nIn your example, both parents have type A blood.  The possible gene combinations (or genotypes) to produce type A blood are AA and AO.  If two people who are both AO have a child, and both parents donate the O to their offspring, the offspring will have type O blood.\n\nWhen it comes to rh factor (the + and -), + is dominant, and - is recessive.  An A+ and A- couple can produce an O- child if the A+ parent carries the - gene.\n\nOne thing to note is that if we're talking about a real life example, be very concerned about the rh factor of the mother and the child.  If the mother has a different rh factor from the child, there could be serious problems with the pregnancy.\n\nI hope that was not overly complicated for you."
"2","what are human bones made of?","","Bone consists of a chemical mixture of inorganic salts (65 to 70 per cent) and various organic substances (30 to 35 per cent) and is both hard and elastic. Its hardness is derived from inorganic constituents, principally calcium phosphate and calcium carbonate, with small amounts of fluorides, sulphates, and chlorides; its elasticity is derived from such organic substances as gelatin, collagen, and traces of elastin, cellular material, and fats. Internal tubular structures called Haversian canals contain nerve tissues and blood vessels that provide bones with organic nourishment. Surrounding these canals is a somewhat porous tissue composed of thin plates, known as lamellae, and usually containing cavities filled with a network of connective tissue called marrow or myeloid tissue. Bone marrow accounts for from 2 to 5 per cent of the body weight of a person and consists of tissue of two types. Yellow bone marrow is made up principally of fat, and red bone marrow is tissue in which red and white blood cells and blood platelets originate. The external portions of bones, enclosing all the components mentioned above, include the compact and hardest of all bone tissue, which is in turn generally sheathed by a vascular, fibrous membrane known as the periosteum."
"4","Is college worth it?","While the cost of a college education sky rockets, the value of a bachelors degree is in decline.

Then they let them selves be trapped by their lifestyle and are now deperessed because they feel stuck at what they are doing so they can maintain the lifestyle. \nFind your nich. while in College find out what you really enjoy. what classes are fun and exciting. what gives you enough excitement ot get out of bed each day.

"1","What is ""ANG DATING DAAN"" mean .... ?","","well, according to Angdatingdaan.org it means (The Old Path) and it refers to ""a Bible Exposition on-air program by the Philippine-based religious organization, MEMBERS OF THE CHURCH OF GOD INTERNATIONAL.""\n\nI don't know anything more about this organization than what I've read on their website, but I would be very wary of them.  On their basic doctrines page, they say, Jesus Christ, a true and Mighty god.  But they don't say The true and  Mighty God.  They talk about God the Father, but I could find no mention of the Holy spirit.\n\nThis website is critical of Bro. Soriano, the leader of the organization.  If it's accurate, it would indicate serious problems with this teacher.  The most notable...\n\n""One of his controversial doctrines is that there is something impossible with God: that it is impossible for God to lie.

"2","What is X-Ray Crystallography?","","It is a way of using x-rays to see the structure of a crystal:\n\nCrystals are three dimensional ordered structures than can be described as a repetition of identical unit cells. The unit cell is made up of the smallest possible volume that when repeated, is representative of the entire crystal. \n\nUsing visible light, it will never be possible to see atoms under even the most powerful of microscopes. In order for an object to be seen, its size needs to be at least half the wavelength of the light being used to see it. Since visible light has a wavelength much longer that the distance between atoms it is useless to see molecules. In order to see molecules it is necessary to use a form of electromagnetic radiation with a wavelength on the order of bond lengths, such as X-rays."

"2","where does all matter go when pulled into a black hole?","","In formal scientific terms, a black hole is called a ""singularity.""  It is a point.  The spherical object often thought of as a black hole is the ""event horizon"" that is centered on the singularity.\n\nThe event horizon is the sphere within which the escape velocity is greater than the speed of light; nothing can exceed the speed of light, so nothing can get out of the event horizon.  \n\nHowever, black holes emit ""Hawking radiation,"" as follows.  ""Consider a virtual electron-positron pair produced just outside the event horizon. Once the pair is created, the intense curvature of spacetime of the black hole can put energy into the pair. Thus the pair can become non-virtual; the electron does not fall back into the hole. There are many possible fates for the pair. Consider one of them: the positron falls into the black hole and the electron escapes. According to Feynman's view we can describe this as follows:\nThe electron crosses the event horizon travelling backwards in time, scatters, and then radiates away from the black hole travelling forwards in time."" [see the fourth link]\n\nBlack holes loose mass by emitting Hawking radiation until all the mass has been radiated.  (Remember that mass can be converted to energy according to E = m x c^2.)  \n\nWhen you do the math, it turns out that each black hole will ""evaporate"" to nothing within a certain time that depends upon its mass, larger black holes having longer lifespans.\n\nA black hole that initially weighs 2 x 10^5 kg (200  metric tonnes) will live one second.  A black hole having a mass equal to the sun will live 10^67 years. (Assuming the Universe does not end before then!)\n\nSo, the short answer to your question is that the mass that falls into a black hole is converted to energy and radiated into space by the black hole."

Some GPA scales are on 100, some are on a 4 scale and some are on a 5 scale.  A GPA scale can be on any scale, which is why it is followed by the maximum (such as your 94.6 out of 100).  There is no national or global standardization, so a 95 at one school may not be better than a 85 at another.  It is very subjective.\n\nWith that said, you can take your 94.6, divide by 100, and then multiple by whatever scale you want.  Your 94.6 on a 4.0 scale would be a 3.784."

In real life, I doubt it. In fact I don't see how people could have thought he won the first fight with Apollo Creed. Creed was too fast and knew how to keep his distance working from the outside, although Creed may have come out too tense in the rematch which led to his exhaustion. Clubber Lang was unproven. And the whole Ivan Drago thing was just a farce. Even with Drago having had only one prior professional bout, Rocky just had no skill.

"5","what is the difference between socket 754 and socket 939 motheboards?","","its the amount if pins on the processor, thus a 754 wont fit into a 939 or visa versa.\n754 was the first mainstream amd64 socket. the max cpu that will be made for it is the 3700amd64. it is going to now be the budget line so it wont be developed a whole lot further as for as mainboard features. it does not feature dual channel memory.\nskt939 is the current enduser socket. processor speeds are going beyond dual core 4800+ processors so there is a definate upgrade path. it can handle dual channel memory. the motheboards have features like the nf4 chipset including SLI, pci-express, better sata options, and more. since better chips/chipsets are being manufactured on 939 it is also perferred for overclockers and \nThe major difference between S754 and S939 is that S939 processors have a 128-bit memory controller and the S754 has a 64-bit memory controller. In other words, dual-channel vs. single-channel. That's it, from the processor's standpoint. As for the other candy (SLI, PCI-E, etc), those are generally to be found on S939 motherboards, simply because those are where the manufacturers make their money."

"9","Why is it that no matter how much you show a large woman that you like her, she's still isn't happy?","I'm a middle-aged white guy who has always been much\nmore attracted to larger women. Perfect for me would be someone between 130 - 180lbs, but they always still want to lose weight!","There are some BBW who are happy with who they are. Others are not.  But you may not be able to do anything yourself to make them change from not being happy to being happy.\n\nI did have one BBW girlfriend in high school who was happy with herself, but it got too serious and, in high school, it just shouldn't be that serious.\n\nAs for those who are not happy with their weight, it's like the old light bulb joke: how many psychiatrists does it take to change -- one, but the bulb has to want to change.\n\nI think some people like to define themselves by what is wrong with themselves rather by what is right with themselves.  They get comfortable in their ""misery"" (I'm too fat, I'm too thin, my hair's straight, it's curly, I can't do this, I don't deserve that, ...)\n\nFrankly, I like women who are voluptuous rather than  not.  Always have.\n\nPoint is that they just have to wake up and smell the coffee and realize what they have in you as a friend or lover.  But, from experience, I don't think there's much you can do to convince them otherwise.  In one relationship, I had to have one foot out the door before they got a clue.\n\nIn some cases, I've known people in relationships with BBW where the woman used her weight as a way of controlling the relationship and limiting the intimacy in the relationship.  And these guys loved these women so much that they couldn't or wouldn't leave.  Why loved these women but, well, to be frank, I don't think these women loved their husbands as much as the husbands loved them.\n\nSo, maybe the thing is not to try and change the women that you meet to make them happy but instead determine if you can live with them as happy (or unhappy) as they are.  It is possible that people can change, but they have to want to change.  And sometimes the only thing that can jolt someone into change is to not to support their habits, but to let them know that you love them but there obsessing is to the point where you aren't sure they're happy being with you and that it is time to move on for your own sake.  It's not a threat, you have to respect yourself and your needs and happiness and they need to respect themselves and you.  Otherwise it can just be a co-dependent mess."

I hope to make it wide and strong enough for one car to drive across.  The stream is about 8 ft wide and usually has no water in it.  It drains about 200 acres.  Can anyone make any suggestions on resources to use to insure ample drainage ect.  \nThanks\nStan \nNashville, TN","You'd have to hire a structural engineer to safely design a bridge for a car.  Also, you'd need to have an engineer assign a flow (Q) value for a given rain event based on the 200 acres.  The Q is a result of the type of landuse upstream.  Then given the dimentions of the channel you'll know how high the water elevation will be given a certain storm event, thus the high of the bridge.\n\nI'd contact the local municipality engineering department to find what the requirements (rain event, freeboard) are for flow and structures.  There might also be an easement on the ditch.  If that's the case, you might not be able to construct a thing."

Sometimes I even recopied my notes\n-for math, I liked to work on the sample problems in the book before attempting the homework.\n-study groups help a lot. when you teach someone something you actually learn it better...and hopefully, someone else can help you out.\n-find time to relax and unwind. don't study 100% of the time.\n-avoid all nighters, plan ahead and manage your time wisely\n-just remember you are paying for college and it's not free. each class you miss is equivalent of several hundred dollars. Teachers don't care if you attend or not (this isn't highschool anymore)\n\nBottom line is, the 4-5 years you work hard in college will pay huge dividends when you are out in the work force. I have seen companies that only interview students with a 3.0 or greater GPA. I have also seen many people waste their lives away partying,smoking, etc...and getting kicked out. It's sad to see.\n\nBest of luck to you!"

I have read some of ur answers and questions and that is the reason why im responding to this. It may be a little long so please bare with me. I asked Jesus into my heart when I was 7 years old... I asked him into my heart cuz I was sick of watching my dad be mean to my mother... and my mother act as tho i was not supposed to be born. I was always told u will go to hell if u dont accept him. So that night I did.\nAs i was growing up I was raised in a home where my Father was a Christian (or claimed to be) and a Wiccan Mother. I was outcasted pretty much since the day I was born because I was not born a boy. Growing up I was beat, molested by my father and the pastor of my church then later in life after i had finished high school I was 14 years old and was gang raped and got pregnant. The guys that did it to me found out and beat me so bad that I was in a coma for 2 months and miscarried twins. I wanted so bad to have a child. I just wanted someone to love me without judging me. My whole life I saw my father drinking, doing drugs and cheating on my mother left n right. I always promised myself that I would be better then that. I pretty much raised myself since I was 10 years old cuz my family had no morals what so ever. I did the best that I could with very little to go on and NO adult role models to look at. When I was 15 years old I was told that I had Cancer. Now when I was born I was born with Tourettes syndrome and a hole in my heart and was not supposed to live past the age of 17 yrs old.    \nMy mother found out that I had cancer and with her being a doctor and having such great insurance she was told that I could have a surgery to have it removed so that it wouldnt become terminal but they would have to do it right away... My mother refused to do it. I have prayed to Jesus everyday since I was 12 years old that he take my life. Take me away from everything especially if no one loved me anyways and all i do is screw things up.I thought this was his way of finaly letting me have my wish.\nI continued to do as I was told. I worked 3 jobs, home schooled my brother, and volunteered at many places like the American Cancer foundation, AIDS Awareness, Retirement homes, Alzheimers Assoc. etc. just doing what i could to never be home and do what I could to help as many ppl as I could. I figured that the more ppl I helped and the happier I acted, the faster Jesus would let me die.\nI made it to the age of 17 when I met my husband. I had t6o get out of the house cuz i was being beat so bad and since i was done with High school I was working 3 jobs to support my fathers Drug/drinking habbit and home schooling my little brother as well.\nI had no choice. I married a man that I knew for 1 month. He was older, and my mother being a doctor and the kind of doctor that she is was treating me that if i didnt work and give them all the money and if i tried to ever go back to college (which I had done right after high school for a degree in Psychology till they made me stop to work) that she would have me thrown into a psych. unit and she would make it so that i could never get out and so i'd never see my little brother again. So anyways I married the first thing that came around. I was married to him for 6 years. He beat me and hurt me so bad. I never had sex with him cause of my past and he atleast respected me that much not to take it from me. I suffered depression by that time so bad that I had gained so much weight. It was so bad that I couldnt walk, i couldnt get up to go in the next room, i couldnt do anything.... except eat. I finaly told my husband that we were moving within 6 months. Either hes going with me or without me. I took those 6 months and I prayed so hard. ""Jesus either help me to fight this crap or help me to die plz""! Jesus Helped me walk! I started studing Property Management. I finished with flying colors so that when we moved I could get a job being the property m"
"7","Why do people believe in color and looks instead of personality, individuality and nice traits???","I mean, a lot of people tend to look at your color and expect you to be what they see. If a person of a different color who is nice helpful and such, and then the first thing tha you see is what they are, religion or personality wise. Like indian people, did you ever think that they might be christian instead of hindu?? Or what about african american people, are they supposed to be into drugs and crap like that because they are black. And you judge them to be what you see on TV?","I guess you are talking stereotyping and unfortunately that continues.  There is no easy answer as to why this continues.  Most of us know that these are poor assumptions and too often not true.  I also think that what you see on television varies as well.  There are plenty of ""black"" shows and charactors on who are not portrayed as into drugs etc.  Many are portrayed as intelligent doctors, lawyers etc.  There is also plenty of white trash TV if you will.  Take for example My name is Earl.  Not all white folks are trashy like that but its on TV.  Just dare to think for yourself and don't fall into assuming things about others.  \n\nMegan"

Push needle through the banana in a pattern forming a square.  At each corner feed the needle back through the same hole that it and the thread came throug.  When you get back to the start hold both ends of the cotton and gently pull the cotton out of the banana.  This neatly cuts the banana without mashing it (like the other idea).  If you do this 3 or 4 times you can peel the banana and eat it in ready made segments.\n\nI remeber the same book of magic tricks."

Or even Why don't Christians acknowledge Muhammad as one of their prophets? Angel Gariel foretold the great news and the revelations to Mary and Muhammad respectively. Another related question is,, is Gabriel Muslim or Christian??","Before I answer this question, I just want you to know I am not either religion, but my religion encompasses all religions (my beliefs come from studying all religions, so I believe in a lot of stuff from multiple religions including both Christianity and Muslem).\n\nMany people can't find God in the same way, so God has formed many religions, so that more people can find him and know how to treat others, ourselfs, and him.  \n\nIt's just like some people don't see Jesus Crist as the savior, that why he said, ""forgive them for they no not what they are doing"".  In my opinion he said that not because they were killing the son of God, but because they killed him for no just cause.\n\nLook at both religions and you will find simular teachings, just done in a different way."

"1","What do you prefer : countrylife or (Big) City life?","","We moved from a big city to a rural area about 8 years ago. I didn't expect that I would miss some of the things I miss about living in town. I guess I just didn't think much about them until they were gone. \n\nI miss the incredible library system to take my kids too that we used to have. We went every week and loved it! The lone libarary building in our county houses a mere 2% of what we used to have access to. They don't even interlibrary loan there. We have had to get an out of county card ($$$) to get access to a slightly larger library with interlibrary loan that we drive 120 miles round trip to access. Needless to say, long gone are the weekly library visits.\n\nI miss having businesses within a quick drive. Driving so far to get anywhere can really become tiresome when you live way out. It is about 60 miles round trip to the grocery store. Want to see a movie? The nearest theater is 120 miles round trip. Now that I have two kids in the church youth group, I find that the time I spend on the road has increased or I have to tell them no to some of the church events because of the 60 mile round trip drive.\n\nI worry about whether my children will be able to live nearby when they are grown because job oprtunities are few here.\n\nOK, now what do I love about the country. \n\nI love the wildlife moments. I love seeing deer come up and drink from the stream that cuts through our yard in front of our living room window. I love the experiences like hearing a noice on the front porch and stepping out to find yourself 4 feet away from a fox or an armidillo - right there on the porch with you! I love hearing and watching the hawks that perch on the kid's swingset in the rain as they watch for crayfish, snakes, lizards, rabbits, and mice that stir in the yard or the edge of the woods. I love the 8 month study of stream life we did two summers ago where we monitored our stream daily, caught tadpoles, minnows, and crayfish for study in our indoor tank before releasing them full grown to create the next generation of crayfish and frogs. I love being surrounded by woods and enjoying the cool of them on hot summer days.\n\nI love the people of the Southern countryside. On average they are so much more humble, friendly, and willing to love you than the average city dweller. A retired lady two doors down calls me darlin', and hun' and always says goodbye with 'I love you.'\n\nI love that we live in a 2000 sq. foot house with a nice big yard and it only cost $40K. We watched one of those home shows on PBS last week and our jaws dropped at the prices they said that moderate priced houses in DC go for. Yikes! How can anyone but the ultra rich ever survive there?\n\nOne warning about rural country life though, when you move to the country they pay you welcome visits even before 8 am in the morning. Not one, not two, but about twelve neighbors and church members paid visits in our first two weeks after moving in to our house all before 10am in the morning. Mornings in the country are an active time of the day.\n\nSo what do I prefer, country life or big city life? I guess after eight years in the country I must be adjusting pretty well now. I guess I will take the long drives to access the conveniences I once enjoyed mere miles and minutes away for the love of country neighbors, the wonder of God's creation, and a morgage that we can afford and still have a life after."

It does not refer to an actual piece of paper which specific parties signed and dated, which can be taken to court and enforced.  A legal contract is all that, for the most part.  It is possible to enforce an oral contract in law, but it is done by analogy to a written contract.  A social contract, in contrast, is not analogous.  It is a way to describe the idea of a committment between government and citizens, or between one group of people and another.  It is a metaphor only, and a judge has no jurisdiction over its enforcement."

Our government is only there to ensure that the general welfare for every citizen is PROMOTED, not provided. This government/country DOES promote the general welfare. Business is encouraged, freedom is put forth. Everyone has the opportunity to do something in this country.\n\nBut the government does NOT exist, nor should it exist, to redistribute wealth from those that do/have earned it, to give to those who ""feel' they deserve more. It is up to the individual to succeed or fail. That is part of your freedom. If you want to have the $$$ you have to put forth the effort. There is NO excuse. If you want it bad enough, it is up to you to find the way. There are plenty of ways out there. Join the military, work a second job, take a community colege course or two, put forth effort at your job to receive promotion, etc. \n\nI get tired of hearing the whiners with the sob stories. ""But I have 3 kids and I can't do this."" ... well quite frankly you chose to do the things in your life that have led you to this point. Everyone has responsibilities.

It gives you a bit more flexibility if your child does not go to college or if he or she gets a scholarship. The only downside to using a roth is losing the tax advantages. You will have to pay ordinary imcome tax on any earnings. I would recommend using the roth exclusively until you can at least max it out. When you get to that point use the 529. I am an advisor and even the wholesalers that come to talk recommend the roth over the 529 if you cant fund it significantly.\n\nextra info: \nThe Roth was created for retirment planning however it does offer penalty free withdrawals for qualified education expenses. Investments will grow tax deferred just like 529 but will be taxable when withdrawn if used for school."

Trask\n(c) The Reverend Mr. Trask\n\nSomething *must* be between the title ""Reverend"" and his last name.\n\nIt is not the article ""the"" to which I am primarily refering, but rather the fact that ""Reverend"" is an adjective.\n\nFormally, he would be:\n\nThe Reverend John Trask; or\nThe Reverend J. Trask; or\nThe Reverend Mr. Trask.\n\nIn conversation, one would address him as ""Mr. Trask.""\n\nIn newspaper columns, for instance, one would properly write:\n\n""The Reverend John Trask preached a controversial sermon yesterday. Mr. Trask is quoted as saying...""\n\nYou should greet the Reverend Mr. Trask as follows: ""Hello, Mr. Trask."" In letters you would write, ""Dear Mr. Trask,"" but on the envelope you write, ""The Reverend John Trask,"" but NEVER in any context do you write or say, ""The Reverend Trask"" or ""Reverend Trask.""","Honey, that reverend has addressed himself properly unless he is the vampire hunter on Dark Shadows.  Then maybe he should name himself vampire hunter or something else.  I saw that entire discussion about him an hour ago.  While I find it all funny, I think Apostate was correct.  It IS in the dictionary and often it is better to change with the times.  As Apostate said before, it's a matter of a person's age, ridigity or flexibility, and openness to accept change.\n\nApostate said Catholics call their priest ""Father"" (as a sign of respect), so it is quite correct and acceptable when other Christians  address their ministers as ""Reverend"" on an INFORMAL basis.  In this 21st century, it IS NOW acceptable in the English language for certain Christians to use the word ""Reverend"" in an informal greeting, though it is used the way you state in a newspaper article.  Isn't an online message board one of the most informal places around? \n\nHe gave several good sources, including the excerpts from the 2006 editions of dictionaries.  I just did a quick search and found so many of them.

Some contend that these are NOW ACCEPTABLE DUE TO COMMON USE. Others continue to maintain that they are both incorrect.""\n\nhttp://www.answers.com/topic/rt-rev\n\nThere are so many references like these which a person can use.

"3","why people sketch while talking through phone?","","For a lot of reasons. It actually depends on the person involved.\n\nFor one thing, it could be because the person is simply restless in nature. People who belong to this category often are found doing other things besides the one that they are currently working on.\n\nAnother, it is probably because it is a habit that one has developed in the earlier parts of one's life. Pressumably the parents of this person is observed talking on the phone with notepads. In an artistic way, this person is incorporating what his/her subconscious has picked up from her past.\n\nStill, it could be that the person is a workaholic. Someone who falls under this catergory cannot simply focus on doing one task alone. For them, though not really intentionally, talking idly on the phone consumes work time. These are the type of people that cannot keep their hands still, and due to the skill inherent to one person, he begins to multitask. Or in this situation, draw.\n\nLastly, it could simply be because the person is simply... uninterested of the conversation and feels the need to do something other than talking idly on the phone.\n\nOfcourse, there are sometimes where in a person is a combination of these categories. ^^\n\nI hope it helps!"

"2","Where does the word logarithm come from?","","A Swiss clockmaker in the employ of the Duke of Hesse-Kassel, first conceived of logarithms. The method of natural logarithms was first propounded in 1614, in a book entitled Mirifici Logarithmorum Canonis Descriptio, by John Napier (c. 1550 - 1618; Latinized Neperus), Baron of Merchiston in Scotland, four years after the publication of his memorable invention. This method contributed to the advance of science, and especially of astronomy, by making some difficult calculations possible. Prior to the advent of calculators and computers, it was constantly used in surveying, navigation, and other branches of practical mathematics. It supplanted the more involved prosthaphaeresis, which relied on trigonometric identities, as a quick method of computing products. Besides their usefulness in computation, logarithms also fill an important place in the higher theoretical mathematics.\n\nAt first, Napier called logarithms ""artificial numbers"" and antilogarithms ""natural numbers"". Later, Napier formed the word logarithm, a portmanteau, to mean a number that indicates a ratio: λoγoς (logos) meaning ratio, and αριθμoς (arithmos) meaning number. Napier chose that because the difference of two logarithms determines the ratio of the numbers for which they stand, so that an arithmetic series of logarithms corresponds to a geometric series of numbers. The term antilogarithm was introduced in the 1800s and, while convenient, its use was never widespread."

However, even if you are an American citizen he will not be able to enter the United States without a visa, husband or not.  Visa free entry to the US is only for American citizens or citizens of the 39 countries in the Visa Waiver Program (Argentina lost this status in 2002).  Of course, if he is Argentine, he is probably also eligible for citizenship in Spain or Italy (through his ancestry), which passport he could use to come and go freely, for stays up to 90 days.\n\nIf you get married abroad, you will have to file an I-130 petition to get him an immigrant visa in order to enter the United States.  If you reside in Argentina, you can do this in BA.  Buenosaires.USEmbassy.gov. \n\nIf you are truly resident there, meaning usually for more than six months, you can go into American citizen services and file your I-130 petition.  In about six months your husband will have an interview and a physical.  If all is okay, he will get his immigrant visa and then one he arrives in the US, he will be able to get his green card.\n\nAlternately, you could choose to file an I-129 for a fiancee visa, which will have him apply at the Embassy in about a year for a fiancee visa (K-1) to come to the United States for the wedding.  After the wedding, which has to take place within 90 days, he will start the process for his green card.\n\nA third option if you are living in Argentina and have no plans to live in the US is for him to get a tourist visa, which he can use if he can show ties to his country of residence.  A tourist visa is not available to intending immigrants, however, and should not be used to enter the US to get married (a consular officer knowing this fact would refuse anyway) nor to reside.  However, if you can show that you are a bonafide expat, and that he has ties there, it shouldn't be a problem to get a tourist visa.\n\nSo you see, if I knew your situation better I could advise you better, as it really varies.  Good luck."

The wingspan of the Galaxy (C-5a) is about 223 feet.\n\nThe 747-400ER is about 232 feet long.  The Galaxy is about 247 feet long.\n\nThe heights are about the same, at almost 64 feet for the 747-400ER and about 65 feet for the Galaxy.\n\nThe maximum takeoff weight for the 747-400ER is 910,000 pounds; for the Galaxy, it's 840,000.\n\nBoeing has announced a bigger version of the 747, the 747-8.  It will have a wingspan of almost 225 feet, a length of as much as 250 feet, and a height between 63 and 64 feet.  The maximum takeoff weight will be 960,000 pounds.\n\nBut, even though the new 747 will be definitely bigger, it still won't have the cool front-and-rear cargo ramps and a cargo bay big enough to drive a tank through, like the Galaxy does."

"7","where can i buy family crest and history software?","","There is no such thing as a ""Family"" crest, although a dozen merchants will sell you a crest or coat of arms that was once issued to someone with your surname. Just Google ""Coat of Arms"" and look for a linkk neding in "".com"".\n\nTwo genealogy programs will help you trace your family history, \nFamily Tree Maker\nRoots Magic\n\nThere are others. FTM is the market leader, I like RM better. They are both $29. Neither will do the work for you. They are to family History what ""Word"" is to a term paper - tools. You have to do the work. They make it easier, but it would take a couple of hours a week for a month or two on your part to get a good foundation.\n\nWrite if you are still interested. Most Yahoo! users are not.\n\nFrom Wikipedia:\n\nThe descent of arms was and remains strictly regulated by inheritance; only certain actual descendents of a particular armigerous (arms-bearing) person are entitled to his arms or a differenced version of them — hence popular associations of a coat of arms with all bearers of a surname are based on a misconception. Heraldry is mostly a hobby today; but in some countries (e.g. Scotland) it remains regulated by heralds and the assumption of another's arms is illegal.\n\nThe word ""crest"" is commonly used to refer to a coat-of-arms. However, in heraldry, a crest is just one component of a complete achievement of arms. The crest sits atop a helmet, which itself sits on the main and most recognizable part of the arms, the shield or escutcheon. Other elements may include supporters holding up the shield and a motto beneath. Crests can in fact be used on their own (this is particularly useful when there is insufficient space to display the entire coat-of-arms); but where the shield alone is used it should never be called a ""crest""."

"2","How can a step down transformer be used for step up or vice-versa ?","","A transformer usually has two windings denoted as HV(High Voltage) and LV(Low voltage) windings. The transformer is used to transfer the power fromn one voltage source to another. So the same transformer can be used as a Step Up / Step down transformer. For e.g , assume you have a transformer whose H.V winding is rated for 11 KV and L.V winding is rated for 6.6 KV. If you connect a 6.6 KV source to the L.V winding then you get a 11 KV output at the H.V winding - this is a step up application.\nSimilarly , if the source available was 11 KV , then by connecting it to the H.V winding you get a 6.6 KV output at the L.V winding - this is a step down application. \nHence, the same transformer can be used for step up / step down. It depends on the source/input voltage available at site."

Male or female? heterosexual or homosexual?","","I think you are as befuddled as most.\nHeterosexual if taken literally means only male and female.\nHomosexual if taken literally means only same with same.\nBisexual refers to any person/s who have ever been with both sexes.  I when young did venture some male-male actions as a consequent of being that age, while now I do not pursue relations with any other human or animal: hence, I am asexual at this time in my life.  However, all considered, due to the sum of things past,I would have to be labled as a bisexual even though I did not enjoy those few curious events and for the bulk of my active life I was content with heterosexuality.  For the longest, always the woman so very worthy of my admirations and best regards.  I'm grateful for them making our babies and for recieving my birth.  Suggest you incorporate the facts of a lifetime in shaping your definition as being a matter of the person's actual history and who do you know that has never went the route of same-sex curiosity?  Life is but the sum of a person's total experiences and it better to be honest since any exception to the facts of venturing at least one bisexual act is a lying person.

"4","what is an encyclopaedia?","","Encyclopedia or Encyclopaedia, reference work that provides information on a range of subjects. Encyclopedias can encompass many areas of interest, or they can focus on a particular field of study, such as a geographic area, an ethnic group, a time period, or an academic discipline. Most encyclopedias have hundreds or thousands of articles, each addressing a distinct topic. Many of the articles contain illustrations, maps, photographs, and other media elements that help readers understand concepts. For centuries encyclopedias were published as multivolume sets of books, but in the late 20th century they appeared in new formats, such as CD-ROM, digital video disc (DVD), and on the Internet. \n\nThe term encyclopedia comes from the Greek words enkyklios paideia, meaning “comprehensive education” and originally signifying instruction in all branches of knowledge, or a comprehensive education in a specific subject. This concept gave rise to the idea of collecting the materials for such instruction into a single work, in which the contents and relations of the various arts and sciences would be explained systematically. Attempts to produce books of this kind were made more than 2,000 years ago, although the name encyclopedia was not given to such works until the 16th century."

Many people are still very racist, but most of the world has grown up in a society that looks down on racism and promots equality."

"4","What was the general breakdown among the Chinese immigrant community?","","The first real wave of Chinese immigrants came to California beginning in 1848 in response to the discovery of gold. They were merchants who sold their stock to the settlers and miners and then went in search for gold themselves. They wrote home to share their experiences and by 1851 there were almost 25,000 Chinese, called ""Celestials"" for the Celestial Empire of China, on the West Coast. These immigrants were almost all from the province of Kwangtung in southern China, traveling through the harbors of Canton and Hong Kong. In rural China of the time, the purpose of life was the well-being of the family group. Many families sold possessions and/or borrowed in order to send one young man to America to make a fortune, not for himself, but to send back home to his family. The idea was to get as rich as possible as quickly as possible and then to return home. Other miners resented their lack of interest in becoming naturalized and by 1852 they were being driven from the mines. Still seeking their fortunes, many turned to jobs which the miners did not want to perform for themselves, such as cooking and laundry. By 1860 many had returned home. Then in 1862 the Union Pacific and Central Pacific cross-continental rail line began construction. A new wave of immigrants came from China through the Chinese Six Companies, organized into crews with their passage prepaid and then deducted from their monthly wages. When the railroad was completed in 1869, some Chinese returned home but for each one who returned, two more arrived. Some 123,000 came in the 1870's. The economy and political situation was against them. The Gold Rush was over and most people had failed to make their fortune. The railroad was completed, the major swamplands had been filled, and industry did not need the thousands of unskilled laborers. An agitator named Dennis Kearney organized what became the Workingman's Party in an effort to drive the immigrants away and protect American jobs. Harrassment escalated until the Exclusion Act of 1882 which was intended to prohibit the entry of Chinese laborers for ten years. Many Chinese left. Those who remained responded by moving away from the West Coast and establishing neighborhoods of their own whereever they went. Family life was the exception in these communities since most immigrants were single young men, or if married, had left their wives at home, expecting only a short stay in America. The Exclusion Laws made it almost impossible to bring family into the country. The Chinese distrusted American institutions and formed their own family associations, district organizations, and halls. Tongs were first founded as social clubs, but some, especially in San Francisco between 1880 and 1900 became involved in crime and vice. The Exclusion Laws were not repealed until the United States and China allied during World War I. Many of the original immigrants had either returned home or died, but enough remained to cause another wave of immigration as families were finally allowed to reunite. Then in 1949 the Communist takeover of mainland China caused a new wave of immigration. Unlike previous waves, many were from the educated and upper levels of society, and they brought entire families at once. This trend of educated, skilled immigrants and immigrants of all ages has continued into today."

For exmample, the attorney must with draw if he/she knows that the client is bringing a completely frivolous action.\n\nIt is really impossible to directly answer your question without knowing type of case you have, how much work the attorney has done or why the attorney wants to with withdraw.

"2","What evidence suggsts that oxygen delivery to tissues has been compromised after total hip replacement?","","To answer your question I really need to know more specifically what you are asking.\n \nDo you mean compromise acutely during the operation or chronically in the post-op setting? Do you mean compromise to all the tissues of the body or only those tissues at or distal to the operative site.\n\nIn general signs of inadequate oxygen (hypoxia) under anesthesia depend on the severity of the hypoxia. Lactic acidosis would be evident via blood gas analysis. As the hypoxia progressed changes in the EKG would begin to manifest ultimately leading to cardiac arrest. Signs of severe hypoxia that had occured in the operative setting include possible changes (temporary or permanent) to every organ system including:\n\nneuro:loss of mental capacity, seizures,blindness\nPulmonary: post hypoxic syndrome \nGI: bowel ischemia \nGU: renal failure, ATN\nHepatic: failure, elevated transaminases\nCardiac: EKG changes, muscle necrosis\n\nOngoing compromise of oxygen delivery in the post-op setting (in the absense of pulmonary disease) is of course a function of blood flow. The signs and symptoms of inadequate blood flow also depend on the severity of the same. If mild- delayed healing might manifest. If severe- changes in color, temperature, cap refill, and pulse volume would manifest as well as possible numbness or tingling distal to the site. \n\nThe problem is that most hip replacements occur in the senior population. The same population that may already have some level of cardiopulmonary impairment to begin with. Most noteably if they have COPD, or they smoke, or they are overweight, or have poor diets or genes that have left them with partially clogged blood vessels."

"2","Why is brain transplant not possible?","","It is actually possible, but you really, really would not want it:\nThey can take a brain out of the casing, but think of it, they'd have to cut all nerval connections to the body: eyes, spine etc. \nThe brain might conceivable be kept alive, properly fixed to a machine that pumps oxygenated and nutrient-enriched blood to the brain, but what would you do then? This actually has been done to a few pitiful lab animals.\nYou would definitely need to hook the brain up to a body again, it would need hormonal regulation (we cannot completely reproduce the body in a lab) but how would you do that in any meaningful way? You would end up with a brain hooked up to the circulation system of a prone body without any sensory or muscular connection - we cannot yet get nerves to reconnect as we want them, else spinal cord injuries could be fixed. So you'd only end up with a terminally isolated brain without any sensory input and without any ability to communicate - sheer hell. For all practical purposes, you'd have a body and a brain worse than dead."

"1","Where did this phrase ""skeletons in the closet"" come from?","","The expression has in origins in the medical profession. Doctors in Britain were not permitted to work on dead bodies until an Act of Parliament permitting them to do so was passed in 1832. Prior to this date the only bodies they could dissect for medical purposes were those of executed criminals. Although the execution of criminals was far from rare in 18th century Britain, it was very unlikely that a doctor would come across many corpses during his working life. It was therefore common practice for a doctor who had the good fortune to dissect the corpse of an executed criminal to keep the skeleton for research purposes. Public opinion would not permit doctors to keep skeletons on open view in their surgeries so they had to hide them. Even if they couldn’t actually see them, most people suspected that doctors kept skeletons somewhere and the most logical place was the cupboard. The expression has now moved on from its literal sense!"

It does effect your ability to get into a college or university that will help your chances of getting accepted into medical school.  Medical School, as I understand it, is not as popular as it used to be, but can still be competitive to enter.  \n\nYour best bet is to major in pre-med, biology, zoology, etc and buckly down to get the best grades you can and prepare for the MCAT exam, which is a key factor in getting accepted into med school.  The college you attend can also be a factor in that a good GPA from a recognized school will be more competitive than from a tier 4 school, all other things being equal.  It also will prepare you better to succeed in Med School."

"1","why do down-syndrome people look a like?","a honest qustion","People with Down's syndrome probably do not all look alike to those who know them personally. There are, however, physical characteristics that they have in common. Down's syndrome is a genetic disorder that was established at the moment of conception. Normally, there are 23 pairs of chromosomes that make up the fertilized egg. One of each pair is from the sperm and the other from the egg. In Down's there is an extra chromosome 21. The medical term is trisomy 21. This is the usual reason for Down's syndrome. \n\nThe most obvious consequenses of having an extra chromosome 21 are an epicanthal fold around the eyes, short stature, dental deformaties, broad chest (that's why they seem to look alike) and mental retardation. The epicanthal fold about the eyes give them an Asiatic or Mongoloian appearance, hence, the older term mongoloid. \n\nAs in any group of people, those with Down's exhibit different personalities and varied abilities."

However, there was some talk awhile back about trying to pass a Constitutional amendment to change that.  I don't think it would ever pass, because people would be too paranoid.\n\nI live in California, and it is true that Arnie's approval rating is down.  When he first ran for governor, I thought he should ""come out of the closet"" as a Libertarian.  But lately he's been more of a Republican, and even making noises like a Democrat, especially in regard to public schools.  I am disappointed in him."

My fav.brother  didn't approve of all the praying that we were doing.  My sister got better and now is a functioning adult with some difficulties.  He returned the Christmas presents from 4 years ago on my parents front porch.   He has not talked with us since my sister got better.  He has changed his answering machine so it is not his voice on it anymore.  He was always there for me when my other family members weren't.  I miss him so much.  I have gone to his house with my niece and no one would come to the door but we could hear someone moving around inside.  I have called, written, and visited but no response.  I love him and I want him to meet my husband and my stepson.","Send him a letter explaining how much you miss him.  Ask his forgiveness for any hurts he may have received, whether intended or not, or even known about.  The thing to remember is that people are very strange when they are stressed with family emergencies.  Also, he may be feeling guilty, or may be afraid of hearing ""I told you so.""  Under no circumstances should you bring up the past; let him discuss what he wants.  Additionally, if you do decide to meet with him, go alone."

The birth rates are declining, and by 2040, the population will stop expanding.\n\nEvery year, 40 million new people join the middle class leaving poverty. As the population is huge, its a huge market, and everyone gets to sell his product/services. And with the flow of foreign investment, its been a huge amount of new jobs being created. And the outsourcing is helping new software professionals trained in India. New agricultural equipment, with farmers getting richer and richer, are getting common, and agriculture is also doing well.\n\nIts not so sweet though, there is corruption, poverty, illiteracy, riots. But we all are determined to make a better India."

"2","what structure in the brain control the rate if breathing and heart rate?","","Now this is a tough question to answer without using a little physiology lingo. Unlike skeletal muscle, which is under voluntary control, the heart is an involuntary muscle. Most of us cannot just tell our heart to slow down or speed up. The beating frequency (heart rate) is controlled by the balance of stimulation coming from the sympathetic and parasympathetic branches of the Autonomic Nervous System. Both nervous imputs to the heart converge on a small area of tissue on the right atrium called the Sino-atrial node. Parasympathetic (rest and recover) stimulation tends to slow down the rate, while sympathetic (fight or flight) input increases the rate (and the force of contraction). Normally, there is a balance between the two inputs leaning toward the parasympathetic side. However, even without any nervous input, the heart will beat automatically due to some unique features of its membrane physiology. This intrinsic rate is quite slow however (about 20 bpm). A purely parasympathetic stimulation will result in a heart rate of about 30. So the average untrained person has a resting heart rate of about 70 as a result of some constant sympathetic stimulation. With training, the balance between parasympathetic and sympathetic stimulation tends to shift in favour of the parasympathetic, resulting in a slower resting heart rate. Elite endurance athletes may have resting HRs of 35 to 40. \nThe part of the brain behind this and breathing is called the Medulla.\n\nIt is the caudal-most part of the brainstem and contains many sensory (ascending) and motor (descending) tracts. The pyramid is an example of the latter. Structures that are linked with the cerebellum and part of the reticular formation are also in the medulla.\n\nCertain groups of neurons in the reticular formation control respiration, and the cranial nerve important for maintaining an open airway and controlling heart rate is located here.\n\nThus, if the integrity of the medulla is compromised, vital functions are compromised and death often results."

"5","What is a hacker?","","Best Answer - Chosen By Voters\n\nThe negative usage of hacker is one who exploits systems or gains unauthorized access through clever tactics and detailed knowledge, that is, through the use of a hack. However, because most hacks do not exploit systems or gain unauthorized access, most people who have enough technical skill to produce clever hacks consider the use of the word hacker in this sense to be bigotry. Malicious hackers in this sense are often called black hat hackers, but it is more appropriate to call them crackers as this is a term which distinguishes the exploitation of security weaknesses from hacking in general. The opposite term of black hat hackers, White hat, are those who attempt to break into systems or networks in order to help the owners of the system by making them aware of security flaws, or to perform some other altruistic activity. Other hackers often viewed negatively include phreakers and software crackers."

While moving it's parallel to the x axes (looks like a '-' that going up).\nA system S', which it's axes are parallel to those of S system, moves in a velocity V in x direction relatively to the S system. A viewr in S' system will find the pole moves while creating an angle with the x' axes (looks like '/').\nWhat is the explanation of this angle, and how can I calculate the angle, using V and u (and maybe C - the light velocity) - pay attention that all velocities can be close to the light velocity.","From what I understood in your question is that you have two objects (two frames of references), S and S'.\n\nEach are side by side, the first object is moving at a constant velocity, u, along the +y axis.  Meanwhile, S' moves at a constant velocity, v, at some angle away away from the y axis in the +x direction such that S and S' stay parallel with eachother.\n\nDiagram:\n\nS------S'\nS----S'\nS---S'\nS--S'\nS-S'\nSS'\n\nYour question did not mention that either object was travelig anywhere near the speed of light, so we can use ordinary Newtonain relativity for this.\n\nIt is just common sense that since S' is moving at an angle away from S and yet stays parallel, it must be moving faster...but how much faster.\nWe know that the +y velocity is S (u) much eqaul the +y velocity of S' (v).  So we know that,\nv*cos(angle) = u\nor to rearrange,\ncos(angle) = u/v,\nso angle = cos^-1(u/v)"

The family was under threat of capture by the German Army. So King George II instructed his brother Crown Prince Paul and his family to leave for Alexandria, while he stayed behind and fought throughout the Battle of Crete with the Greek, British, Australian and New Zealand Armies - eventually escaping across the mountains. \n\nFrom Alexandria, Prince Constantine's family moved to Capetown in South Africa, to live in the 'Grooteschuur House' of the South African Prime Minister, Jan Christian Smuts. King Constantine's first memories are of holding the hand of the South African leader and chasing a cow off a bed of tall flowers across the well-manicured lawns. \n\nHis younger sister, Princess Irene was born in South Africa on 11 May, 1942.\n\nThe Royal Family returned to Alexandria, where Constantine remembers talking fluent Arabic with those working for the family. \n\nAfter World War II, Greece was in turmoil. In 1946, after a General Election, a Referendum was held and King George II and the family returned. \n\nKing George II died in 1947 and Constantine's father, King Paul I, ascended the throne. As Crown Prince, Constantine attended the funeral of his Uncle King George II, holding his father's hand in the procession.\n\nFrom 1949, Crown Prince Constantine attended Anavryta High School in Athens - a school based on the educational principles of Professor Kurt Hahn and modelled on Hahn's own creation, Salem School in Germany (like Gordonstoun in Scotland). \n\nKing Constantine says that he loved the camaraderie of boarding school, and associating with other children - most of whom have become lifelong friends. His class (now bankers, businessmen, professors and doctors) meets for a reunion every year. He was good at sport (hockey, volleyball, high jump) and became Head Boy. He acted in school plays, and remembers playing Mark Anthony in Shakespeare's 'Julius Caesar' (he can still quote large sections of the play). \n\nDuring his time at the school, he had military training every weekend and, after school, attended the three military academies - the army, navy and air force. On his 18th birthday, as the only son of his parents, he took an oath of allegiance in each of the armed forces.\n\nIn 1960, he became the first Greek to win an Olympic Gold Medal since 1912. He achieved this in Sailing (Dragon Class) as helmsman on the 'Nereus' in the Bay of Naples. \n\nHis sister Sofia (now Queen of Spain) was a member of the substitute crew, but trained as intensively as her brother. On his return, he received a public welcome in Athens. \n\nIn 1960, Constantine went to Athens University to study Law. He also visited the USA to see military and industrial establishments. \n\nDuring these school years, he attended many State visits with King Paul and Queen Frederica - Italy, UK, West Germany, Lebanon, Ethiopia, India, Thailand. \n\nHe met World leaders, including President Tito of Yugoslavia - when he had an "

But she talks at home and says some very wise things for her age . But has learned nothing in school and cries hard when I try to teach her . Its breaking my heart she is so beautiful and sweet .I am in a place where there is no special Ed and they are telling me to give up well maybe not that but they say she can't go to their school unless I proof she is able to learn . Please can anyone help ?","Well, if you are in the United States, if it is determined she need special ed, they are legally obligated to provide it.  In other countries the rules might be different, but I believe that in most developed countries the public schools are required to provide a program to meet your child's needs...\n\nBut she may not need special ed.  First off, if she doesn't talk at all at school she may be selectively mute.  When kids are selectively mute, it's not necessarily that anyone did anything wrong (it can be caused by trauma, but it doesn't have to be), but psycotherapy can help.  Next, for your discription of her behavior, it sounds like she probably has some form of a learning disability.  I don't doubt that she's smart, but for whatever reason she doesn't process things in a 'normal' way.  Get her tested!  Be sure to find someone good to test her, even if it costs you more and/or you have to go farther from home, believe me it's worth it.  A psycological assessment will tell you what's going on, and provide some recommendations about what to do about it (this is why you want a good tester - if the person testing her doesn't know much the report won't tell you much).  In US public school, the results may also provide legal grounds to force the school to provide a suitable program (and I expect this is the case in public schools elsewhere, although I don't know for sure)."

The really tricky thing is that he only has a month or so.... Suggestions?","A ""little tricky"" is putting it mildly, try a little impossible!\n\nLosing 15 lbs in a month is totally crazy (a FEW pounds!!??).   Funny how he waited until the last minute to decide on this.\n\nA pound of fat contains 3500 calories, so if you lost 1/2 a pound a day you would need to use 1750 calories a day, or the equivalent of running 20 miles.   That also assumes you don't take in more than your basal metabolic rate (very lttle food).  A goal of 5 lbs might be more reasonable.\n\nAnyway, try aerobic exercise (running, biking) to burn the calories and some weight work to put on some muscle.\n\nOh...and yoga for losing weight and putting on muscle.  Not likely!"

A 10 minute in-person session cost me over $200.\n\nAre these prices too high or standard for Ontario lawyers?  Is there any kind of pricing regulation imposed on Ontario lawyers I should be aware of?\n\nThank you.","There probably is not a price cap on lawyers in Ontario. In the US, anyway, rates are entirely contractual.  $20 for a brief letter is pretty standard -- cheaper than the rates in big US city, actually.

"7","any suggestions on what job philosophy majors should pursue after college? try to be creative?","","As I had the same problem sometime ago, I can tell about my experience, which happened to be in Romania (South-Eastern Europe), but I would have done the same anywere:\n1. Philosophy is nowadays useless as theory, unless you cannot prove practical applications of the general principles of whatever sistem of philosophy you've been studying. So, first of all, think of ways to apply philosophy in real situations.\n2. A good ""philosopher"" is a good speaker, because of the debates and training in logics, game theories, ethics and so on. All kind of jobs are ready for you: Public Relations, Media Advertising, Career Counselling (after deciding your own), even politics, at the level of communicating to the mass of voters. Somehow, modern philosophers are in fact communicators or, even worse, manipulators.\n3. Strangely, bu philosophy could help you start new business. Think about the thousands 9milions) of people with no direction in life, in need of a ecclesiastic advice. Maybe you could save the world, but expect the unexpected: people hate prophets.\n4. Take my example and combine all the three points above in making a carrer in NGO sector. Thus, you can: apply every principle of philosophy, communicate them through your own projects to the community and the system, and give hope back to those are willing to listen and assume a sense for their lives.\n\nHope it helped you. If not, imagine you are in Romania. This would give you the hint that some things should be viewed in perspective.\n\nYour,\nArdengo Modugno (nick), 28 y.o ""philosopher"""

Generally, clearly show your name, mailing address, email address if available, and best phone number(s) to contact you.\n3. Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake). You should instead indicate what you have accomplished and the results.  Use action verbs.\n4. If you are looking for your first job or intend to change job function / industry, you may want to state your objectives.\n4. There is no one “correct” format.  It depends on your profession and personal style.\n5. Also, try not to use technical words and jargons. Do not abbreviate.\n\nYou can post your resume at:\nhttp://www.monster.com\nhttp://www.careerbuilder.com\nhttp://hotjobs.yahoo.com\n\nOther good references are:\nhttp://www.vault.com\nhttp://www.wetfeet.com\n\nI would also go to your bookstore and find a resume book in the business/career section.

London dispersion\n2. Dipole-dipole\n3. Hydrogen bonding\n4. Ion-Dipole\nThese four are listed in order of increasing strength.  \n\nNow, when intermolecular forces are high, the molecules are really stuck to each other.  Such is the case in water molecules, H2O. This molecule experiences hydrogen bonding, which is a strong intermolecular force.  That's why water exists as liquid under normal conditions.  \n\nHowever, CO2 molecules (carbon dioxide) only experience London dispersion, the weakest form of intermolecular forces.  This is why carbon dioxide is a gas.  \n\nNow, we can make liquid molecules like water break away from each other if we supply the molecules with enough energy to do so.  We can do this by heating water until it starts boiling, which is, by definition, when water becomes gas."

The Bsus2 is the chord while the /B indicates the inversion that is being played (The note that is the lowest). Since the lowest note being played is the root then the chord is in its first inversion. That means that the /B part is redundant and not necessary. The author of the tab should not have notated the chord this way because it is confusing. Since the /B part is not necessary you should play a regular Bsus2 chord.\n\nFor more information visit (found via Google):\nhttp://www.all-guitar-chords.com/"

"2","Where is the eath's centrifugal force?","","From wikipedia:\n\n""Centrifugal force (from Latin centrum ""center"" and fugere ""to flee"") is a term which may refer to two different forces which are related to rotation. Both of them are oriented away from the axis of rotation, but the object on which they are exerted differs.\n\nThe reactive centrifugal force is the reaction to the the centripetal force. This is equal in magnitude to the centripetal force, directed away from the center of rotation, and is exerted by the rotating object upon the object which exerts the centripetal force. As it is an actual force, it is always present, independent of the choice of reference frame. ""\n\nIn terms of the earth's rotation about the sun, the magnitude of earth's centrifugal force is the gravitational attraction between the earth and sun.  Its direction is the vector from the middle of the sun to the middle of the earth (actually, from the center of gravity of each).\n\nIn terms of an object on the earth's surface or in orbit about the earth, the centrifugal force is, again, equal to the force of gravitational attraction between the earth and the object.  The direction of the force is from the earth's center through the object."
"6","What is the real difference between a Tasco Riflescope and a Leupold, other than image clarity?","I want to know if in reality a cheap scope will affect so much my rifle accuracy to spend $500 - $1000 in a scope.  If they are really so bad what is the difference.\n\nRemember I'm not talking about image quality that I know will be better in a more expensive scope but for Bench Rest Shooting this is not as important as accuracy ( Shoot to Shoot repeatability)","Two main differences, both related:\n\nOne, the Tasco scopes usually have 1-inch main tubes and many (most?) Leupolds have 30mm tubes. That extra 5mm means extra elevation adjustment before your stadia (the thing that holds the reticle) hits the side of the scope.\n\nSecondly, the Tasco has two adjustment knobs; one for elevation and one for windage. But the configuration is like this: One knob at 12 o'clock, one at 3 o'clock, and one spring at 7:30 to press the stadia against the adjustment knobs. It's a common configuration, but it means that as you adjust the windage, the elevation can change as well. Leupold uses 2 springs placed 180 degrees from the adjustment knobs - so a knob at 12 and 3, and a spring at 6 and 9. It makes the scope more repeatable as you make adjustments.\n\nIf all you want to do is sight in your rifle at, say, 200 yards and then shoot a deer or two a season, the Tasco will do just fine. if, however, you're dinging clay pigeons at 700 yards with a quartering wind you'll want the scope that can perform for you.\n\nA really simple test of a scope's adjustment mechanism is to shoot a 3-shot group at the center of a large piece of cardboard - right at a target dot. Then move your windage a few minutes of angle to the right - I like to move it 6 minutes, or 24 clicks on a 1/4 moa scope. Place the reticle on the same target dot, and press the trigger 3 times. Now adjust your elevation 6 minutes up and repeat, then 6 minutes left, then 6 minutes down. You should have a perfect square defined by the 5 groups you shot, with the group in the lower left being 6 holes and the others being 3. If you have anything but a square, or your ending group isn't at the same place as your beginning group, your scope has a repeatability problem when adjusted."

"3","What is a good way to naturally increase my energy throughout the day?","Sometimes it takes me more than an hour or two to get up in the morning (I try to get up early, but end up hitting the snooze button from 6-8am). When I commute to class by train, I find it hard to stay awake for the 40+ minute ride. After classes when I study in the library, sometimes I have to take a nap to get thru things. And I've tried caffeine, but that only gets you so far. What else can I do?","Exercise is a great way to get energy, especially cardio exercise.  I bought some dance tapes, I especially love DANCE Fat Burning Party by Crunch Videos.  Another thing that will help is MAKING yourself get up for a week, maybe two when the alarm does go off.  I used to be a snooze button hitter myself, and that much disturbed sleep is not sleep at all.  Also find a time to go to bed and stick to it, most people need between 6-9 hours of sleep a night, I have found the best to be 7-8, going towards 9 hours and people start to get too much sleep, which can make you just as tired as not enough sleep.  When you wake up in the morning especially when you start getting used to your schedule, splash your face a couple of times with cold water, and so come stretches over all your body.  Good luck! :)  And don't hit the snooze button any more.  :)  TRUST ME."

"3","I'm still hungry after I eat and I am trying to loose  weight.  What can I do to feel full w/out eating more?","","try taboo\nWHAT to eat for losing weight\n\n• Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables, especially NC (negative calorie) food.\n\n* Print these lists. They will be your ... ""Bible"", from now on !\n* Dill and parsely - include them in all your salads. Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck"

"2","why do some concrete mixes contain flyash?","are there alternatives to flyash in a mix design?","There are a few explainations.\n\n1.) Fly Ash is much cheaper than cement.  With the prices of natural gas and the fact that production of cement requires a rotary kiln that is heated by natural gas the cost of cement has gone through the roof.  From my understanding a ton of cement has increased in price by like 20% over the last year or so.\n\n2.) Fly Ash is a natural pozzulan and water reducer.  Fly ash lowers the water requirements of the concrete mix making for a much stronger concrete.  Fly ash slows early strength gains but increases late strength gains as well as increasing workability.  Think of it like this.  You put rocks in a jar and there's voids, then you fill in those voids with sand, water, and cement but there's still small voids so you use fly ash to fill those in.  You can still have voids and use other things to fill those in but that's for another question.\n\n3.) Fly Ash is a waste material (from coal fired power plants i believe don't quote me).  The federal government requires its use in some of its projects or at the very least recommends it.  It is considered a green material and i read an article in Concrete Construction magazine (Jan 2006 issue) about HVFA (high volume fly ash) mixes.  They will replace like 51% of the cement with Fly Ash in the mix and get tremendous late strengths out of the concrete.\n\nThese are three of the main reason's for the use of fly ash.  As sustainable building (green construction) continues to gain backing you'll probably find more use of fly ash in concrete.  Also with it being cheaper people will want it used.\n\nStrictly speaking Fly Ash DOES NOT increase the density of the concrete.  Fly Ash has a specific gravity of about 2.00 (meaning for a given volume it weighs 2 times the same volume of water), Cement has a specific gravity of about 3.15.  If you have 3 cubic feet of cement then it will weigh 589.68 pounds (3 x 62.4 x 3.15).  If you substitue 1.5 cubic feet of that for Fly Ash then you will have [(1.5 x 62.4 x 2.00)+(1.5 x 62.4 x 3.15)] or 187.2 + 294.84 = 482.04 lbs. (a cubic foot of water weighs 62.4 pounds i believe).  Fly ash actually lowers the unit weight of the concrete, because for a given volume it weighs 63.5% of what portland cement does."

Amorous words, Or closeness can be a sign, Or If mayhaps you have been around this man for quite some time, he may have a small crush on you. Flirting is diffrent than love itself, so Keep in mind: Flirting cannot allways lead to a long lasting relationship. Depending on your age though, It may be quite difficult to tell the diffrence."

"5","do you think powerbook is still better than macbook pro?","","Yes and No.\n\nFor the average user, the new MacBook Pro offers faster startup time and many applications that are designed for the new (to Apple) Intel processor that will run faster than before.  \n\nThis is one side of the story.  Many computer users choose Apple for use in design projects ranging from graphics to film editing.  Applications like Apple's own Final Cut Pro, Motion, and non Apple programs like Photoshop (Macromedia)  will most likely run faster on the older Powerbook G4s because they are not written to work natively with Intel processors.  This does not mean these programs will not work on the MacBook Pro, they will just run slower because they require a special (invisible) program to allow them to run on the Intel processor.  \n\nFor the average user, however, the MacBook Pro is well worth it."

"2","Radiator holds 12 quarts. 8 quarts of water, 4 quarts of antifreeze. How do I get 50% mixtue? Two part answer.","","First, pour the eight quarts of water from the eight quart container into the radiator.  Then, pour the four quarts of anti-freeze from the four quart container into the ""now empty"" eight quart container.  Empty enough water from the radiator to continue filling the eight quart container, there will be four quarts left in the radiator, but the eight quart container will contain a 50% mixture.  Finally, empty the remaining four quarts of water from the radiator into the ""now empty"" four quart container, then pour the eight quarts of 50% mixture into the radiator.\n\nNow, you still need to put in four quarts of 50% mixture.  Pour the four quarts of water that is left into the eight quart container, then add another four quarts to make it a 50% mixture again, and mix well.  Pour half of that mixture into the radiator and you now have twelve quarts of 50% mixture in the radiator and four quarts of 50% mixture left over."

Today, it is being most horribly abused, to condemn people's land so it can be used for commercial enterprises like shopping centers.  The Institute for Justice, which I think is www.ij.org, is on it.  This (and other Libertarian fights against injustice) matters so much to me that I've named the Institute for Justice as the contingent beneficiary in my will.  The fact that my estate is tiny is not the point; it's the thought that counts.  Besides, a hundred tiny estates could add up to a pretty fair chunk of money."

No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslim officials block the exit where school girls are trying to escape a burning building because their faces were exposed. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims cut off the heads of three teenaged girls on -their way to school in Indonesia. A Christian school. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims murder teachers trying to teach Muslim children in Iraq. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims murder over 80 tourists with car bombs outside cafes and hotels in Egypt. No Muslim outrage.\n\nA Muslim attacks a missionary children's school in India. Kills six. No Muslim outrage.\n\nÂ· Muslims slaughter hundreds of children and teachers in Beslan, Russia. Muslims shoot children in the back. No Muslim outrage.\n\nLet's go way back. Muslims kidnap and kill athletes at the Munich Summer Olympics. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims fire rocket-propelled grenades into schools full of children in Israel. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims murder more than 50 commuters in attacks on London subways and busses. Over 700 are injured. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims massacre dozens of innocents at a Passover Seder. No Muslim outrage.\n\nMuslims murder innocent vacationers in Bali.

No Muslim outrage.\n\nNewspapers in Denmark and Norway publish cartoons depicting Mohammed. Muslims are outraged.\n\n\nDead children. Dead tourists. Dead teachers. Dead doctors and nurses. Death, destruction and mayhem around the world at the hands of Muslims .. no Muslim outrage ... but publish a cartoon depicting Mohammed with a bomb in his turban and all hell breaks loose.\n\nCome on, is this really about cartoons? They're rampaging and burning flags. They're looking for Europeans to kidnap. They're threatening innkeepers and generally raising holy Muslim hell not because of any outrage over a cartoon. They're outraged because it is part of the Islamic jihadist culture to be outraged. You don't really need a reason. You just need an excuse. Wandering around, destroying property, murdering children, firing guns into the air and feigning outrage over the slightest perceived insult is to a jihadist what tailgating is to a Steeler's fan.\n\nI know and understand that these bloodthirsty murderers do not represent the majority of the world's Muslims. When, though, do they become outraged? When do they take to the streets to express their outrage at the radicals who are making their religion the object of worldwide hatred and ridicule? Islamic writer Salman Rushdie wrote of these silent Muslims in a New York Times article three years ago.\n\n""As their ancient, deeply civilized culture of love, art and philosophical reflection is hijacked by paranoiacs, racists, liars, male supremacists, tyrants, fanatics and violence junkies, why are they not screaming?""\n\nIndeed.

All the same I do want to know what some one honestly thinks and feels on topics like the war in Iraq. - Did the public school system stop teaching civics?  Where is it patriotic to only express supporting, ( my country right or wrong ), opinions? \n\nIn a free market place of ideas, it is said the truth emerges.  Is this what some folk are trying to suppress?","Of course freedom of speech is protected.  As with all freedoms it is not cake once baked but a flowing stream where the banks must always be worked with to keep the flowing free. \n\nTo restate the obvious:\n\nCongress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peaceably to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.  - First Amendment to the Constitution of the United States.\n\nThis words as stated are clear and concise, but they are not cast in concrete with no maintenance need.  Rather, they are a fertile bed which needs constant care of weeding and fertilizing.  The court is one type of weeding . . . . \n\n“The main purpose of constitutional provisions like the First Amendment was said to be, to prevent all such previous restraints upon publications as had been practiced by other governments, and they do not prevent the subsequent punishment of such as may be deemed contrary to the public welfare.”\n\nre: Patterson v. Colorado [1907].\n\nJustice Holmes expanded when he opined in Schenck v. United States [1919] “It well may be that the prohibition of laws abridging the freedom of speech is not confined to previous restraints . . . . But the character of every act depends upon the circumstances in which it is done.  (Then he uttered that most famous phrase)  The most Stringent protection of free speech would not protect a man in falsely shouting fire in a theater and causing a panic.”\n\nThe point is the that the courts have altered  and refined our view of this amendment (not the freedom).\n\nSo too is lobbying (a form of petitioning) a tool you can use to ensure that your perspective of this amendment (vis-à-vis the individual right of freedom of speech) is given worthy attention.\n\nFreedom of speech is real and protected, but the question is, will you (any you) work to ensure it stays protected?."
"1","is religion fact or something else we have no idea of? Thanks?","","I find your options too limited.  Its never been about facts, its about hope love and charity.  We all have a good idea what those virtues are, but there is not a fact among them.\nDoes a parent love their child?  You can't do experiments on that to decide, black or white, its true or false.  As the Savage Garden song goes, ""I believe parents did the best they knew how to do"".\nDo you know if an elevator is safe, for a fact, before you go into it.  No, if you had to prove everything before you believed it - assumed it - you would be frozen with uncertainty.\nThe best you can hope for is reasonable certainty.\nReligion is reasonable, though many religious people are totally unreasonable in they way they talk about religion.\n\nI guess you think science is all about facts, but most of it is theory, reasonable assumptions.  Data have to be reasonably accurate but even with the best intentions, the next experiment could show a weakness in a theory.  That why they do the experiment.\n\nSo lets open our minds with a good degree of humility and be reasonable in the way we treat each other, we are all in this together."

""Whether it's temporary or not remains to be seen.""\nBut it wasn't Bush's political opponents alone who saw weaknesses. So did his allies — listing the days of chaos in New Orleans after the hurricane, the nationwide confusion over the drug prescription program that forced many states to step in to help seniors get medications, and the ports security debacle that has drawn criticism from leading Republicans in Congress and the states.\n""I don't think he was well served on the port issue by the bureaucracy,"" said Republican Dirk Kempthorne of Idaho, who is leading a united front of governors pushing back on potential reductions to National Guard forces. ""He's at the forefront on national security. When you combine this flap on the ports, and these potential cuts on the military, you need to make sure that issue doesn't slip away. It's one of his strengths.""\nHe also said the lack of communication from the administration on the Guard issue has been a problem. ""There has been too much we have learned outside the loop. It's time we be inside the loop.""\nRepublican Bob Taft of Ohio offered judgment on Katrina: ""This is hindsight, but it was a mistake to bury FEMA under the Department of Homeland Security.""","wow, you've sure done alot of thinking on the issues. i'm  extremely concerned about us outsourcing our ports to terrorist nations. what the hell - why don't we just outsource the secret service to iraq. as far as katrina is concerned i feel that they did what they could for those people. if you have millions of people in this situation the government  cannot possibly take care of them all. it doesn't matter who's running the show. i would firstly blame the people living there who were warned to evacuate the city but didn't. it falls down to personal responsibility. \n\nperscription benefits for seniors - who will pay? it's a lot of loot.\n\ngeorge bush has failed the people in this country by not securing the borders and  ports and too much spending, something usually done by the dems.  as far as arnold s. is concerned he seems more concerned about making a name for himself then anything else. he has sure switched sides big time. i don't think he is concerned about the ports because people would think he's a racist - go figure."

"7","What does A.D.  stand for when placed after the year? example 300 A.D.?","","As we look forward to AD 2000, what does the AD mean? A generation ago, there were still schoolchildren who could tell you that AD represents a Latin term, “animal dominoes” or something. Not anymore. As a result, AD is now sometimes replaced by CE (for “Christian Era”, or “Common Era”).\n\nThe term “AD” was created by a monk named Dionysius Exiguus in 525 AD. Before that time, dates were calculated by an individual king’s reign (“In the fifth year of Emperor Augustus”, “In the second year of King Henry VIII”) or dated from the founding of a kingdom or an empire.\n\nDionysius noticed that kings died, and even empires vanished (the Roman Empire, after flourishing for centuries had collapsed just the century before). This created confusion, with some people following one calendar, and others another calendar. (This confusion is why Dionysius made a mistake of 4-6 years in trying to calculate the year of Jesus’ birth.) Dionysius therefore proposed establishing a calendar based on a kingdom which would never end. He began counting time from Jesus’ birth.\n\nAD literally means “In the year of the Lord”. Thus, this year, instead of being the seventh year of Jean Chretien’s prime ministership, is the 1999th year of Jesus’ reign. In establishing the “AD” calendar, Dionysius was not just finding a convenient starting point for a calendar. He was declaring that he accepted Jesus as his King and that he was a citizen of the Kingdom of God. Those who follow Jesus today, declare the same thing.\n\nby Jim Coggins"

"7","how can harassment be prevented at work?","","The best thing is to give a training video for all new hires, and have a written policy on the companies view on harassment, what constitutes harassment, and what the consequences are.  Most people will behave themselves if they know the organization takes it seriously.  Have each person sign a sheet that they have received the training, so if anything happens, you can show that your organization did not create a workplace permissive of this behavior."
"10","How can we stop the Jewish lobbists?","The US government is corrupt because of the Jewish Politicians (some, not all) who have such great power that they influence the media and our own government into thinking that Palestinians are bad. However if one actually looks at the rest of the world, one will realize the most countries do not support Israel.","Jewish political power in America is unassailable, as it had become in Germany before Hitler.  Hitler's solution was the only answer there and then.  It resulted in what he called the Jewish War - WW11.  Because he lost that war, everything he said is now called wrong.  In time, history will vindicate his opinions, unless politically correct hypocrisy succeeds in permanently smothering the truth, as it has done up to now.\nThe terrible mess in Iraq, called a war, is very certainly a Jewish war.  Israel is the one and only country which benefits from it and it was Israel which caused it - or, for the benefit of the brain-dead majority who will read this, the American support of Israel.  It was, dear dumbos, this support which turned the Islamic world against America, culminating in 9/11, which in turn caused the Iraq attack."

"3","what are uterine leiomyoma?","","they are very common benign tumors (the most common tumor in women) of the smooth muscle tissue in the muscular layer of the uterus. They are a celular proliferation of fusiform cells  with very low mitotic activity that usually arise in several groups.\n\nThey are benign, I insist, because they are well limited and have little or no mitotic activity (cell division), which isn't irregular either (the DNA does not get mutated when they divide). they may cause bleeding or discomfort, which is why the woman should go to her gyno. surgical treatment is usually completely curative and doesn't involve any loss of function (as in a histerectomy or anything)."
"2","can you give me information on Scolopendra?","","Scolopendra gigantea, commonly identified to as ‘Peruvian giant yellowleg centipede’ or ‘Amazonian giant centipede’, is the world's largest representative of scolopendras which can reach lengths of up to 26 cm. The species inhabits the North and West regions of South America and the islands of Trinidad and Jamaica. It feeds on lizards, frogs and birds. The body consists of 21-23 segments which is ‘coppery red’ or maroon in color and comprises of up to 23 pairs of yellow-tinted legs (with one pair per body segment); the legs are adapted for fast walking (even running) and for holding tight the prey before poisoning and killing it.\n\nThe centipede has modified claws which curve around its head and can deliver venom into its prey to help the immobilization of it. The venom is toxic to humans (the poison contains acetylocholine, histamine, and serotonin) and causes a local sharp pain (similar to a hornet-sting), and severe swelling, chills, fever (up to 39º), weakness.\n\nS. gigantea is a popular pet among arthropod fanatics – however the centipede should not be handled without protective equipment given that even a trace of the venom coming in contact with skin can cause a reaction. The condition of having been poisoned by the venom of a centipede in the genus Scolopendra is called scolopendrism.\n\nFemale S. gigantea centipedes exhibit parental care, guarding and tending their nests of eggs. Juveniles are very dark red or black in color, and very thin with large spherical red heads. They molt several times before reaching adult size.\n\nRetrieved from ""http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scolopendra_gigantea"""

And it happens because those two people have found a connection between them--a spark.\n\nHomophobia's greatest danger is the unwillingness to believe that gays are capable of real human emotion.  That their ""urges"" are unnatural and strange, and whatever happens between ""them"" is some kind of perversion.\n\nTwo men fall in love with each other because they wanted it to happen or they just couldn't stop it from happening.  You know--just like normal people.\n\nI don't mean to sound harsh or judgemental, but your question suggests that you at least have some preconceived notions about gays.  Why don't you start now by trying not to think of gays as different.  It will give you a whole new perspective on things."

"2","Why do ants touch each others antennas as they pass by each other?","","Like many other insects, the body of an army ant has a head, thorax and abdomen. The head has a mouth, eyes and antennae. The mouth has two jaws called mandibles that are like scissors. Still, army ants can only swallow liquids because the solids form a ball that the ant spits out. Unlike other ants, army ants do not have compound eyes, but instead have single eyes (but they are still blind). Army ants use their antennae to sense smell and touch. This is how they know which colony and nest they belong to. They use their antennae to communicate as well. The thorax is connected to the head by joints called nodes. The thorax is between the head and abdomen. It is connected to the abdomen by a narrow waist called the petiole. The abdomen is in the shape of an oval. That is where the stomach, large intestine, sting, etc. are located."

There are obviously many complicated processes going on in a living creature that can be described as physical and chemical processes, and we are slowly starting to understand them. \n\nHowever, is it possible to produce artificial life by just producing the correct machinery? Or is there something else involved? There is progress being made towards imitating the systems we observe in nature in the laboratory. Will they be alive in the same way? What about more advanced life forms? What is consciousness anyway? Does it come spontaneously with a certain structure or does it take something else?\n\nI do not think anyone really knows yet. However, there are probably strong theological arguments why the actual ""life spark"" or ""consciousness"" requires some sort of supernatural intervention.

"10","Do u think the govern should ban assault rifles?","I was reading the sunday paper when i came across an article about Newark's rise in gun violence, i am scared out of my life right now, b/c i was suppose to go to Rutger's law school a yr later, which is located in Newark! I strongly believe we should ban guns all together except for of course, the police, the soldiers, and others who help out with the public's safety, but other than that i dont think the citizens should have a right to have guns, plus in our Const., it doesnt say citizens have the right but the militia has the right to use guns!!","This will be a debated subject for as long as the United States is a functioning republic. There is no question that the initial reaction to any type of violence is repulsion and to some degree fear. You and I (and thankfully most Americans) wake up every day, trying to do what is best for ourselves and our communities. It never crosses our minds to harm another.\n\nBut there is another element in our society that is not wired this way. The are predators who seek out harm innocent people. Most of us will never be a victim of a violent assault or an attempt on our lives or on the lives of a loved one; but, heaven forbid, if that situation were to arises, how would you respond? If you give up control to the predator and let them injure or kill you or your loved one, then that is a conscious choice. If however, you value your life and the the lives of your loved ones, you will realize that the police cannot protect us one on one.\n\nMany studies have shown that weapons in the hand of law abiding citizens are used thousands of times of year to PREVENT a violent act from occurring. A recently published report by the Federal Government stated that the numerous restrictive gun laws (including the Assault Weapons Ban) had had no effect in reducing violent crime. In fact, just the opposite was true. In each of the States that have passed Concealed Weapons Laws, violent crime has been reduced.\n\nIf you take the time to study these statistics in thoughtful way, you may begin to understand that it is not the instrument (the gun) that is inherently harmful.\n\nCareful study of the intent of the 2nd Amendment reveals that citizens of that day were extremely distrustful of a central government. No doubt, the citizens of any repressive regime would agree that only allowing the government, police or military to have the guns is a bad idea.\n\nAnyway, this is just some food for thought. I know that you probably have already made up your mind on this issue. I rarely (if ever) had heard anyone say lately...""Gee, I never thought of it that way...""\n\nPerhaps you will surprise me."

The cops just give them all the evidence they found and think could be useful and the analyst picks out a few things tha have the best chance of having the suspects DNA or other important evidence. There isn't time to analyze every single item left at a crime scene. You have to pick out the important things.\n\nTests take way longer to get back than on the show. The show would be ridiculously boring if they had to wait days or weeks for tests to be done.\n\nIn real life they don't really find that much evidence. This is actually becomming an issue in courts. They call it the CSI effect and it is very damaging. Jurors want to see concrete DNA evidence on everything or they think there must be some doubt. As if people have a floating cloud of DNA around them that leaves evidence on everything they touch. It just doesn't work that way."

It is an abnormal growth of cells which tend to proliferate in an uncontrolled way and, in some cases, to metastasize (spread). \n\nCancer is also called malignancy. A cancerous growth or tumor is sometimes referred to as a malignant growth or tumor. A non-malignant growth or tumor is referred to as benign.

"1","Did Noah really say close the door, we can't wait for unicorns.?","Every year, on March 17th I hear this song played in soooo many places.  It's about unicorns (might be The Unicorn Song) and in it, Noah says to close the door and not wait for the unicorns.  Do you think that is true?","maybe what rev. trask needs is a horn on his head, the guy is and idiot, i cannot imagine anyone wanting this person for their spiritual leader.\n\nDoes the Bible support the existence of unicorns, which are mentioned in some versions?\n\nThe King James, Douay, and other versions, mention unicorns. But that is not so with modern versions that accurately render the Hebrew.—Psalm 22:21; 29:6; 92:10 (21:22; 28:6; 91:11, Douay).\n\n“People once believed that the unicorn’s horn contained an antidote for poison, and during the Middle Ages, powders supposedly made from such horns sold for extremely high prices. Most scholars believe the image of the unicorn was derived from hearsay European accounts of the rhinoceros.” (The World Book Encyclopedia) Certain Assyrian and Babylonian monuments showed one-horned animals. These are now recognized as stags, ibex, cows, and bulls depicted from the side, a view that did not show both horns.\n\nTranslators were long uncertain as to what animal was meant. The Greek Septuagint rendered re´em´ with the sense ‘of one horn,’ or unicorn. The Latin Vulgate often translates it as “rhinoceros.” Other versions use ‘wild ox,’ ‘wild beasts,’ or ‘buffalo.’ Robert Young simply transliterates the Hebrew into English as “Reem,” basically leaving the reader in the dark.\n\nModern scholars, though, have eliminated much confusion over the re´em´. Lexicographers Ludwig Koehler and Walter Baumgartner show that it means “wild oxen,” with the scientific identification Bos primigenius. This is a “subfamily of the large horned ungulate family.” The New Encyclopædia Britannica explains:\n\n“Certain poetical passages of the Old Testament refer to a strong and splendid horned animal called re´em´. This word is translated ‘unicorn’ or ‘rhinoceros’ in many versions, but many modern translations prefer ‘wild ox’ (aurochs), which is the correct meaning of the Hebrew re´em´.”\n\nSince in current English “ox” has the sense of a castrated male, the New World Translation of the Holy Scriptures consistently and correctly renders re´em´ “wild bull.” The aurochs (wild ox, or bull) seems to have become extinct by the 17th century, but scientists have deduced that it was quite different from the unicorn of legend. The ancient aurochs had a body height of about six feet [1.8 m], and a length of some ten feet [3 m]. It might weigh 2,000 pounds [900 kg], and each of its two horns could be over 30 inches [75 cm] long.\n\nThis certainly accords with the Biblical mention of the re´em´, or wild bull. It was noted for its strength and intractable disposition (Job 39:10, 11) as well as its swiftness. (Numbers 23:22; 24:8) Evidently it had two horns, not one horn like the legendary unicorn. Moses referred to its horns when illustrating the two powerful tribes that would spring from Joseph’s two sons.—Deuteronomy 33:17.\n\nSo the Bible does not support the idea of unicorns as renowned in legend. It does draw an accurate, though limited, picture of the massive and fear-inspiring aurochs, or wild bull, that existed in Biblical times and down into the not-too-distant past.\n\nNO UNICORNS, PROBABLY NOAH WAS WAITING FOR THE TURTLES TO GET ON BOARD"

Anyone know?","Wellbutrin was given to depressed people and it was found that some of the smokers also stopped as a side effect. So the drug maker marketed a new product now called Zyban. \nZyban or Wellbutrin are SSRs, meaning - they are a class of drugs dealing with selective serontonin re-uptake.  It is designed to 'top up' the serontonin supply, which act on the brain's neuro pathways triggering a supply of 'mood changing' chemicals... similar to the reaction smokers get from nicotine.\n\nZyban has side effects, some serious and occaisionally fatal, and it does not help with the habitual or psychological addiction to smoking, which are very important.

After Jesus’ ascension to heaven, Peter, noting that not only had the psalmist David foretold Judas’ deflection (Ps 41:9) but David had also written (Ps 109:8) “his office of oversight let someone else take,” proposed to the approximately 120 disciples gathered together that the vacancy of office be filled. Joseph Barsabbas and Matthias were put up for selection; after prayer, lots were cast, and Matthias was chosen. Occurring just a few days prior to the outpouring of holy spirit, this is the last instance reported in the Bible of the lots being resorted to in determining Jehovah’s choice in a matter.—Ac 1:15-26.\n\nAccording to Peter’s words (Ac 1:21, 22), Matthias had been a follower of Christ throughout Jesus’ three-and-a-half-year ministry, had been closely associated with the apostles, and was quite likely one of the 70 disciples or evangelists whom Jesus sent out to preach. (Lu 10:1) After his selection, he was “reckoned along with the eleven apostles” by the congregation (Ac 1:26), and when the book of Acts immediately thereafter speaks of “the apostles” or “the twelve,” Matthias was included."

Browse through the listings and see if you can find any grant that would support a for-profit venture.\n\nThese government grants generally support non-profit organizations, intermediary lending institutions, and state and local governments.\n\nFor private grants, you may want to check the Foundation Center's Foundation Grants for Individuals Online. It's a subscription based website ($9.95 per month) but their opening blurb only says that the database is ideal for ""students, artists, academic researchers, libraries and financial aid offices."" Entrepreneurs are apparently not one of them, so I take it they also don't have listings of private foundations who give grants to would-be entrepreneurs."

This is what prompted the senators to go ahead with execution plans in 44BC.   \n\nNow the Ides of march as you have seen above for simplicity sake is generally accepted at the 15th of march.  The term comes from Roman mythos which gaves names to the 1st(Kalends  -spelling anyone?, 7th (nones)and middle (Ides)days of the month.  The calender was supposedly created by the founders of rome romulus and remus.  the rest of the days were described by counting days from or to one of the above days.... example Ides of march and five days would be the 19th of march.... think roman numerials.   Now some months the Ides fell on the thirteenth of the month.  Now this term was used all the way until shakeperes time fluently probably due to the classical nature of roman literature.

"4","what is the function of a lysosome?","","The lysosomes have sometimes been likened to ""The Police Force of the Cell"". Even in a place as small as a cell, we need someone to keep things in order. But unlike the police, these lysosomes literally eat things which disturb the natural order of the cell. Lysosomes pick up foreign invaders such as bacteria, food and old organelles and break them into small pieces that can hopefully be used again. If they pick up a really harmful invader, they will eat it up and expel what is left of it out of the cell so that the debris can be removed from the body. \n\nThe lysosome is able to do this because it is filled with enzymes. These enzymes are specially made for the lysosome by the rough endoplasmic reticulum and work only at low pH (highly acidic) levels. The reason for this is that the enzymes are so strong that they could eat the whole cell if the lysosome ever let them out. However because they can only work at low pH levels and the rest of the cell has a neutral pH level, they can be neutralized if they accidentally escape from the lysosome. \n\nElectron micrograph of lysosomes. \n\nLysosomes are produced in the Golgi apparatus \n\nFrom here they are dispersed throughout the cytosol. Despite the fact that the range of enzymes found in lysosomes are fairly uniform throughout many types of cells they take many forms. For example some are comparatively large (up to 1 um in diameter) whereas other present as small vesicles (25 to 50 nm in diameter). This variation is most evident in macrophages which are cells specialised in ingesting particles and organisms which have invaded the body. Along with similar organelles called peroxisomes they form what is known as the acid vesicle system . \n\nWithin the human acid vesicle system there are more than 30 defined acid hydrolases present in various types of lysosome. \n\nAnother function of lysosome in the human occurs during fertilization of the egg by the sperm. The head of the sperm cell contains a package of lysosomal material called the acrosome. The enzymes from this are released when the sperm makes contact with an egg and they effectively bore a hole through the cell membrane of the egg allowing the sperm to enter. \n\nLysosomes also play a key role in destroying old organelles within the cell and thus allow them to be replaced with fresher, more effective ones. \nThis process is known as autophagy and is accomplished in two stages. Firstly a membrane is donated by the endoplasmic reticulum. This membrane then surrounds the old organelle. Secondly a lysosome fuses with this membrane to form an autophagic vacuole. The lysosome can safely enter it's deadly enzyme contents into this vacuole and destroy the old organelle. \nIn human liver cells it is calculated that at least one mitochondria undergoes autophagy every 10 minutes. This reflects the highly active nature of the liver as an organ and it's need for a constant supply of fresh organelles. \nThe electron micrograph below shows a lysosome in the process of destroying a membrane bound mitochondria."

It's my husband's mom! She is driving me up the wall! Honestly, I think she's a crappy mom because when my husband was younger, she didnt care if he was dead... as long as he was out of her face. Now that we're married, it's a different story! She acts like he is her pride and joy, when we all know better! And she acts so different in front of me than she does around him. Like for instance... We were at a store and she came up to me and nicely asked if the baby could spend the night with her. I told her no, so she then walked over to him and started begging him. I feel that if one parent says no, the answer's no! Needless to say, he said no too. She always whines around him. I guess she thinks she'll get her way if she's like that but I got news for her - she wont! Anyways - why is she like this?","haha join the world lady! ALL in laws who are ego maniacs are a pain in the rump! She has issues obviously. I would not talk to your husband about it for he won't care. Just deal with it with her the best that you can.

"1","what would my 17 year old girl friend want for  valentines?","","Hey you cannot really argue against material gifts (i.e. flowers, chocolate, electronics, special clothing items, jewelry, watches, movie, dinner, etc.) – especially personalized stuff.    If you can afford it, give her as many as you can.   But remember the basic rule:  It’s usually better to give one really cool/classy gift than 2 or 3 “cheap” ones.   However, to stand out, make a real impression and go above and beyond the crowd you MUST give her an emotionally romantic gift too.    I leave it up to you to think what would be more appropriate in this case; after all, no one knows her as well as you do.    But if you want my opinion, I would suggest you hold her hands close to your heart, look deep into her pretty eyes and just say something to the effect like:  “I AM NUTS ABOUT YOU”.    A word of caution:  If you don’t really feel it do NOT say it (unless of course you are a darn good actor!)    By the way, I’m specifically using the word “NUTS” here since, at your still tender age of 17, saying phrases like I LOVE YOU in the above context might just come across as a bit too strong, intimidating and/or pretentious."

This awkward initialism was jokingly expanded as ""People Can't Memorize Computer Industry Acronyms"" or ""Personal Computer Manufacturers Can't Invent Acronyms"". A later revision of the PC card is known as CardBus. The PCMCIA is also developing a new notebook peripheral specification called Newcard or ExpressCard.\n\nThe first PC cards (PCMCIA, with the more logical IBM meaning: Peripheral Component Microchannel Interconnect Architecture) were Type I, and supported actual Memory Cards (e.g. ATA Type I Flash Memory Cards), such as DRAM or flash memories. Type II cards added I/O support in addition to memory applications, and type III expanded on this. The interface's role as I/O for various devices has largely superseded its role as a Memory Card, but this role did spawn a generation of flash memory cards that set out to improve on the size and features of ATA Type I cards (CompactFlash, MiniCard, and SSFDC(Smartmedia)).\n\n \nType II and III PC Cards. The Type III is twice the thickness of the Type II.Contents [hide]\n1 PC card \n2 CardBus \n3 ExpressCard (Newcard) \n4 External links \n5 See also \n \n\n\n[edit]\nPC card\nA PC card is about the size of a credit card. There are three different sizes, varying in thickness: Type I is 3.3 mm thick, Type II is 5.0 mm thick and Type III is 10.5 mm thick. All are 85.6 mm long and 54.0 mm wide. Most notebooks used to come with two Type II slots or one Type III. With the removal of legacy ports, most notebooks now only come with one Type II card slot. Fortunately, most Type III cards were normally external hard disks that have since been replaced with USB, FireWire and now Serial ATA solutions, along with flash memory options. Memory cards such as ATA Type I flash memory cards continue to be available for the PC Card Type I.\n\nAs the original name suggests, the first PC cards were for memory expansion. However, the existence of a usable general standard for notebook peripherals led to all manner of devices being made available in this form. Typical devices include network cards, modems and hard disks.\n\nThe electrical specification for the PC card is also used for CompactFlash, so a PC Card CompactFlash adapter need only be a socket adapter.\n\nThe form factor is also used by the Common Interface form of Conditional Access Modules for DVB broadcasts.\n\n[edit]\nCardBus\nThe original PC Card bus was 16-bit, similar to ISA. CardBus is effectively a 32-bit, 33 MHz PCI bus, in the same physical form as the earlier cards. The notch on the left hand front of the card is slightly shallower on a CardBus card so a 32-bit card cannot be plugged into a slot that can only accept 16-bit cards. Most new slots are compatible with both CardBus and the original 16-bit PC Card devices.\n\nCardBus includes the bus mastering ability, which allows a controller on the bus to talk to other devices or memory without going through the CPU. Many chipsets are available for both PCI and CardBus cards, such as those that support Wi-Fi.\n\n[edit]\nExpressCard (Newcard)\n \nExpressCards compared to the predecessor PCCard.The PCMCIA has developed a replacement for the present CardBus standard, called ExpressCard (originally codenamed Newcard), which is claimed to be faster and less complex than CardBus. The host device supports both PCI Express and USB 2.0 connectivity through the ExpressCard slot, and each card uses whichever the designer feels most appropriate to the task. The cards are hot-pluggable.\n\nExpressCard supports two form factors, ExpressCard/34 (34 mm wide) and Expre"

"3","Can misaligned bones in your neck cause pain around your tailbone?","","Yes!\nEverything is connected.  If you neck is tight, your body will re-align your shoulders and upper torso so that you cause the least amount of damage to the already-hurting area.  This causes discomfort in your mid-torso...causing the mid- and lower-torso to shift.  On down the line, your lower-torso is in a state of discomfort...etc...etc...all the way down to your tailbone.\n\nDoctors have even shown how a bad shoe (poor foot alignment) can cause headaches.\n\nYou will be surprised.  Have a doctor (sports med. or chiropractic) adjust your neck, and wait...and it will all adjust itself back to normal, and pain-free.\n\nGood luck!\n\n(remember, it took time to hurt...it will take time to heal)"

Help? how can i make friend? or meet (hopefully) a best friend, or should i be happy with my boyfriend??? Help????????????","I would tell you that you should get involved in some school activities to meet people.  You think it's hard now, wait until later!  It gets even harder when you're out of school.  I can tell you from personal experience because I was with a guy of 8 years, we moved all around the country, and I lost touch with everyone I knew.  Now I'm back here in my home town and I'm lucky to have been able to hunt down 2 of my old friends.  I'm not with the guy I was with for 8 years anymore and I have no idea how and when I'll meet my next boyfriend because I don't know very many people.  \n\nMoral of the story.. make friends now, make GOOD friends, who are gonna be around for a long time. You have no idea how things will end up with your guy, if things don't work out and you have no friends to get you out of the house you'll be so miserable.  Just remember, it only gets harder as you get older to meet new people.  Do it now.  You'll be a better girlfriend for it, too, because you won't be relying on your guy to entertain you or go do such and such with you all the time.  That was an issue between my ex and I as the years passed, it was really hard on him.  It was hard on me, too.  I went shopping with my friends the other day and I realized how awesome it was to have someone to help me pick out clothes to buy and to run back and forth and grab different sizes for me so I didnt' have to keep going in and out of the dressing room.

"7","what is APR as it relates to home loans?","","IT's the true cost of obtaining the loan in terms of interest rate.\nThe APR will typically be the same or higher than the note rate.  The note rate is the actual rate/payment you pay against the loan.  \nThe fees involved directly raise the rate by virtue of being added to (sometimes subtracted from in the case of a ""no fees"" loan)the loan balance, after which the APR is calculated.\n\nIn most cases , the lower the APR (compared to the note rate), the better.  But not always.  This is a complex issue, and depends on many factors, such as how long you plan to keep the property, etc..\n\nA good loan agent can help you make the choice."

What 'sparks' might be most likely to precipitate it? Are there any close parallels? \n\nAlternatively is this a myth and house prices are fully justified and will continue to rise?","Read the article I wrote: ""Is the Housing Bubble Real?"" http://burlingamerealtor.com/serendipity/index.php?/archives/2006/02/16.html\n\nI suggest reading ""Are You Missing The Real Estate Boom?"" by David Lereah\n\nReal Estate prices can't go to zero, unless there was a reason for people to flee that area or the interest rates shot up suddenly and much higher than what we could imagine, whatever the size of that area. It's not likely that interest rates will shoot up quickly. So ask yourself if the people of the area you are thinking about have a reason to leave the area suddenly.\n\nIf they don't, then there will likely be no real estate bubble in that area. \n\nReal Estate is not a short term investment and it's not as liquid as stocks. Stocks can go to zero but it's EXTREMELY difficult for real estate to go to zero.\n\nThe real estate bubble scare has been brought upon by stock brokerages and/or the media since they are tied together or invest in each other. Don't buy into it.\n\nReal Estate is a finite commodity. However, stock shares can be split forever it seems. Also real estate is unique, even if it's in the same complex, if a condo. Is each share of the same stock unique? No, one share of MSFT, for example, is exactly like another share of MSFT! \n\nSo in my opinion, yes real estate can drop by 10%, 15% or 20% but I wouldn't call it a bubble. The price will likely come back up in time, unless the area has been cursed forever. For less risk, buy in an area that's got potential, is near good schools, near shops, near transportation, has a good real estate history and near jobs.\n\nMy strongest suggestion if you are serious in buying is to speak to a good Realtor, (go to http://www.ReferredPro.com) to be referred to one, who can give you some guidance, especially since they work with lots of people in your shoes who are thinking the same thing and lots of others who are making money in real estate.

Overall, they did a good job. The only call that they missed was that block by Hasselback, other than that, they made all the right calls.

We are in a very high deficit right now and are deeper in it since the last Bush was out.

"10","do you think that iran want to get nuclear weapons?or nead nuclear enegy for its industries?","who knows that usa is true or iran ?and is it logical that iran dosnt have to do nuclear experiments?","The issue of Iran is a complicated one.\n\nOh, to answer the nationality question, I'm an American. But I'm also a political scientist, so I look at this a bit differently.\n\nIran's nuclear enrichment program is really a diversion. You have to understand that Iran, along with Iraq and North Korea, were labeled members of an ""axis of evil."" Now, the United States invaded Iraq. And the Iranians know that the United States could overrun North Korea in about six weeks. Add to that the fact that we have troops in Pakistan and Afghanistan, as well as Turkey, and what do you have?\n\nA surrounded and very nervous Iran.\n\nThey see that as soon as North Korea starts tossing around nuclear weaponry as a potential, the United States quickly backed off any sort of war footing and started talking negotiation. In reality, nuclear weapons (or the perception therein) give the Iranian government a big bargaining chip.\n\nPlus, the United States is much less likely to invade Iran if they have a suspicion that the minute they step over the boarder, New York vanishes in a cloud of radioactive dust.\n\nAs for nuclear experiements, I'm assuming you mean testing a bomb. They won't, at least if they're smart. THhey'll give the impression that they have one, maybe even parade one down main street of Theran. But to test one would make it clear that they have a nuclear weapon, and that makes them a target.\n\nMy biggest fear about Iran having a weapon of mass destruction is not that the Iranian government would use it. Indeed, they have no system for delivering it, even to Israel. What the fear is for me is that they will lose the bomb - that is, some scientist who feels like the West screwed him might give one to a terrorist.\n\nIn reality, the fewer nuclear weapons on the planet, the safer we all are."

"10","psychologically; what made timothy mcveigh do it?","","I think McVeigh was one of those people who are looking for validation.  Because he was a little strange, a little different, he didn't get that in the mainstream of society.  So, he got in with a bunch of kooks and he looked pretty normal and as a matter of fact he could stand out and be a leader in that group of right wing conspiracy kooks.  He was relatively smart and he was also very guliible at the same time.  He was perfect lacky for the nut jobs that he associated with.\n\nHe was a model soldier in the U.S. Army because he was gun ho and followed orders, never questioned authority.  But when he was rejected by the Green Berets because he failed their grueling physical tests, he lost faith.  This rejection devasted him.

A momentous volcanic explosion on Aug. 23, 1883, blew up most of the island and altered the configuration of the strait; the accompanying tsunami caused great destruction and loss of life along the nearby coasts of Java and Sumatra. The explosion is classed as one of the largest volcanic eruptions in modern times; so great was the outpouring of ashes and lava that new islands were formed, and debris was scattered across the Indian Ocean as far as Madagascar. Since then there have been several lesser eruptions."

Here are two definitions, with appropriate links:\n\nIn information technology, gap analysis is the study of the differences between two different information systems or applications, often for the purpose of determining how to get from one state to a new state. A gap is sometimes spoken of as ""the space between where we are and where we want to be."" Gap analysis is undertaken as a means of bridging that space. Among the various methodologies used to perform gap analysis is IDEF, a group of methods used to create a model of a system, analyze the model, create a model of a desired version of the system, and to aid in the transition from one to the other.\n\nor:\n\nGap Analysis is a scientific means for assessing to what extent native animal and plant species are being protected.

"7","what is the diffrence between market order and limit order in stocks?","","Stocks are quoted with bid and ask prices. \n\nIf you place a small market order to buy, you will get filled near the ask. If you place a small market order to sell you will get filled near the bid. Market orders execute at the best market price going.\n\nWith a limit order you specify a maximum price you will pay or minimum price you will sell for. You might not get filled with a limit order.\n\nIf you really want to buy at the market, place a limit order 5 or 10 cents above the ask. Do the same below the bid if you want to sell. This way, if there is a moment of illiquidity, you're not getting filled at some outrageous price."

"4","If I am leaving from Indiana do we need passports?  also what is time difference there?","","Aruba's currency is the guilder / florin denoted by the letters 'Awg.' but also widely known as 'Afl.' The official rate at which banks accept U.S. dollar banknotes is Awg. 1,77 and checks at Awg. 1,78. The rate of exchange granted by shops and hotels ranges from Awg. 1,75 to Awg. 1,80 per U.S. dollar. U.S. Dollars are widely accepted in Aruba, and banks may exchange other foreign currency.\n\nTraveler's checks are widely accepted and there is no charge for using them in hotels, restaurants and stores. Major credit cards are accepted at most establishments while personal checks are normally not accepted. \n\nThe Aruban florin is divided into 100 cents and there are coins of 5, 10, 25, 50 cents, 1 florin (100 cents) as well as the 5 florin coin. The square shaped 50 cent ""yotin"" coin is probably Aruba's best-known coin. \n\nBanknotes are issued in denominations of 10, 25, 50, 100 and 500 florins. Many souvenirs are made with the square 50 cent coin while the coin itself makes a unique gift for numismatic friends.\n\nCash may be obtained with MasterCard, Visa and American Express cards at credit card offices, banks, in some casinos and via Western Union. ATM cards and credit cards are accepted by ATMs of Aruba Bank, Banco di Caribe, RBTT Bank, and Caribbean Mercantile Bank. The card must have either a Cirrus or Visa Plus logo. ATM instructions are normally given in Dutch, English, Spanish and Papiamento. Cash is normally dispensed in local currency.\n\nTravelers with ATM cards bearing the CIRRUS, MAESTRO or Plus System network logos can withdraw cash in Aruban florins. Home bank accounts will be debited in dollars at a favorable exchange rate, and a 1% - 3% service charge will apply, depending on your credit card company. Before departing for Aruba, it's important to verify whether your PIN number will work in Aruba by calling 1-800-4-CIRRUS\n\nAruba is in the Atlantic Standard Time zone. You didn’t say what time zone you are in (Indiana is in two time zones).  If you’re in the Eastern time zone, Aruba is one hour ahead.\n\nPersons planning to visit Aruba as a tourist for a period not exceeding 90 days for the purpose of recreation, sports, health, family reasons, study, religious purposes or business must submit the following documentation:\n\n·A U.S. passport.\n·The necessary documents for returning to the country of origin (valid permanent resident document)\n·Proof of sufficient funds to stay in Aruba;\n·Return or onward ticket and other documents required for the next destination (visa etc.).\n\nNon-compliance with one of the above mentioned documentations might result in refusal of entry to Aruba. The immigration of Aruba based on the funds the tourist is traveling with shall determine the period of stay in Aruba.\n\nTo: Miss Demanda,\n\nHow many people are missing or killed here in the U.S. every year?  Should all foreigners stay away from the U.S.?  \n\nHere is a quote from an MSNBC news article on Natalee Holloway:\n\nViolent crime is virtually unheard of here. Last year there were two murders, I believe, and those were considered to be drug related and that was it. There were maybe six rapes. When you are talking about an island nation with so many visitors, that is considered an extremely low crime rate."

These can range from a couple engaging in a little kinky play in the bedroom, to a real-time 24/7 Master/slave relationship.  As such activities become more popular, they have also become more socially acceptable (to some extent), thanks to movies like ""The Secretary"" and TV shows like ""CSI.""  I think you might be surprised to find out how many people engage in some form of the lifestyle, once inside the privacy of their own homes and bedrooms.  Most of the literature that I've seen on the subject coincides with the previously-given figure of 10% of the population or so."
"2","How come when you pee against a wall it spatters on your shoes, but not if you use a urinal?","Who is the mastermind that invented the wonder of the urinal? ow many of you (women exempted from this little quiz, unless you're truly bizarre) have peed against a vertical object? What happens?  The splatter-demons, of course.  Ya pee on your shoes.\n\nBut not true with a urinal.  The pee slides right down.  Is it the engineering?  Is it the marvel of porcelain?  How does it work?  I want to know.  Somebody sat in a little room ,thinking--""You know?  Everytime I pee against the outhouse wall?  I get splatter.  I think I better do something about that.""  And he--I'm assuming it was a he--sorry for the sexist thoughts, ladies--he actually had to test it out, dozens of times, pee all over his shoes.  And what if your trajectory is just a bit long? or a bit *ahem* short?  How then commenceth the splatterage?  But this simply does not happen.  We don't ever hear of somebody coming out of the urinal saying ""the splashback was incredible.Piss all OVER my shoes.  Nope.  No sign that splatter","walrus,\n\nDude, that's hilarious...the fact that you're articulate, spell things correctly and phrased the question just so makes it all the more humorous.  Anyhoo...\n\nYou did notice that the urinal is constructed in a concave shape, instead of being straight up-and-down...this concave shape aids tremendously in preventing urine from being directed right back at you, the way it would, say, if the stream would hit a standard wall which you speak of.  This in conjuntion with porcelain, which possesses a ""slippery"" surface to which liquid is directed to slide down the surface of, makes it's design a great answer to prevent making water on one's shoes.  The little ""bowl"" built into the bottom of said urinal also prevents urine from coating one's footware...the bowl aids in one's aim as well as long or short trajectory, and the splatterage caused by each.  As long as the individual is not too intoxicated, one knows not to stand too close to the backdrop if one knows that his stream is strong...one will get splatterage regardless of design if the stream is adequately strong enough to cause it.\n\nkoo koo cha-koo"

The argument will never cease until it is done.  \n\nWith current technology, we know of no way to build a tunnel through a molten rock environment.  Or perhaps there is a way, but it is very expensive.  So if someone has an idea on how to protect the tunnel with a forcefield or something weird, then it could be done.  Maybe someday our technology will allow us to have better heat shielding.

"7","innovation in technology is a tremendous source of bargaining power?","","Innovation in technology, creativity, new solutions might be powerful for many companies, specially these days. We introduce an article ""The key to progress"" by G. Haesen, F. Fernández, J-C. Venchiarutti.\n\n""In traditional industries many processes could be made more efficient and less environmentally harmful, but resistance to change often leaves new ideas on the shelf. Sharing knowledge and experience of new techniques is critical to their acceptance, as the case of the printing industry –\nwhere the Subsprint project has helped introduce new methods for cleaning presses – shows.(...)Estimates indicate that offset printers in the European Union use around 100 million litres of organic solvents per year to clean their presses. According to experimental evidence, somewhere between 60\nand 90% of these petroleum-based solvents evaporate into the atmosphere, making the printing industry Europe’s second biggest industrial emitter of\nvolatile organic compounds (VOCs). VOCs in the atmosphere contribute to the thinning of the ozone layer and create smog at ground level; they can also be\ndamaging in soil or water. Print workers inhale organic solvents throughout their work, with the highest exposure levels experienced while cleaning presses. VOCs are known to have harmful effects on lungs, kidneys, liver and skin, and may also affect the nervous system. Replacing the traditional organic solvents with vegetable-oil-based cleaning products\n– which are generally biodegradable\n– would not only reduce environmental\ndegradation but would also have significant benefits for the health of print workers. Subsprint was one of the first technology transfer projects supported by the EU, launched in 1993, and it aimed to encourage the substitution of organic solvents in the printing industry with vegetable cleaning agents (VCAs).(...)With the accompanying measures launched within the Fifth Research\nFramework Programme, we aimed to set up a pilot platform to support the sharing of knowledge. It became clear immediately that the diverse backgrounds\nof team members and the different business sectors involved made it necessary to define a common language during the design of the platform. Such a common language should streamline the knowledge transfer process by facilitating\ncommunication, and by uncovering similarities and differences which may be\nleveraged in the sharing process. This process has substantially succeeded,\nalthough the partners had to overcome significant obstacles before they came to acknowledge fully the importance of trust in the knowledge transfer process. Today, more than ever, firms rely on information and knowledge exchange to facilitate the uptake of new technologies, processes and approaches. Haesen believes that companies aiming for success in the knowledge-based economy must become learning organisations, focused on efficiently acquiring knowledge from sources such as research – on both technical and non-technical sources – consultants, strategic partnerships with other companies, and the knowledge of their own employees. Protecting investments through patents is a short-term solution, but sharing knowledge is an essential step for organisations to become competitive."""

The company owners in US modified my benefits and my  job conditions in general.

Could i expose this case in the US court? Doesn't matter that  I am not living in US?","One of the biggest things with this is that it is an american company. Because they are in mexico, the company should have some type of code of ethics policy for working outside the US.

"2","If man evolved from monkeys and apes, why do we still have monkeys and apes?","","Hi. This question has already been asked here, both in the Science and in the Religion categories.  The best answer I can provide is the same I gave then.\n\nOh no, not this question again. Why doesn't anybody use the Search button?\nLet me address two separate issues (the first part is modified from another answer):\n1) The pattern of evolutionary processes that can be seen (in the fossil record and living species)can be of two types: \nIn _anagenetic_ (meaning ""that generate upward movement"") events, an entire population evolves in one direction and becomes so different that at some point the people who study it give it a different name. This is encountered in paleontological research and the decision to separate one from the other is ultimately arbitrary. \n_Cladogenetic_ (meaning ""that generates branches"") events entail a population that splits into different sub-groups; each of these then evolves independently from the others. We share A COMMON ANCESTOR with living apes, but we have not evolved from them directly. \nOur direct ancestors are fossil hominid species. \nAll the species that are living today have their separate evolution and history; also they all (including humans) share common ancestors from which they (we) have inherited our common traits. And apes have their own ancestors that are closer to them than to Homo sapiens; the fact that apes are our closest living relatives does not exclude the existence of more related _extinct_ relatives.\n\n2) What you're stating is one of the arguments that many creationist use, namely, that change within a species (adaptation, i.e. microevolution) is possible (they are astute in not denying this, because the proofs are overwhelming!), but a species cannot transform into another (macroevolution). \nThis is based on a mistaken concept of ""species"". Most people think in terms of the biological species concept, which is based on reproductive isolation. That is, individuals of each species cannot hybridize succesfully with individuals of other species. However, there is not a single path for the rise of the mechanisms for recognition or isolation that we perceive as the ""real boundaries"" of a species. What the taxonomist calls a species may respond to different species concepts (such as morphological, evolutionary, biological (isolation), paleontological, recognition, etc,), and there are many examples of populations in which speciation (total isolation) is on the way, and there's a thin line between ""subspecies"" or ""geographical races"" and valid species (just ask an expert in systematics, which I am not). \nEvolutionary processes are long-term phenomena, and it may seem that there are ""evolutionary leaps"" from one species to the other. But although there are particular cases of ""instantaneous speciation"", most of the ""leaps"" are due to the fragmentary nature of the fossil record. So many populations become extinct or become something else and their former existence is not recorded anywhere! But although the record is fragmentary, life is continuous.\n\nSorry for the lengthy answer, I hope you find it useful."

Wrong! They come for dictators (and their business partners) to do their business. And when there's nothing else left to take away, they leave.\n\nDictatorships (at least in Latin America) were only about ideology. Wrong! Dictators (and their accomplices) stole money and properties from the people they captured, killed and took their children away from.\n\nDictatorships are a necessary evil. Wrong! In democracy, a bad government is taken away when its term ends, by voting for a better government. There's no need to call dictators in.\n\nDictatorships have high moral standards, and act according to them. Wrong! What's moral about overthrowing a democratic government, in the first place. And what is moral about killing, robbing, making people disappear, and all of that in the name of a supposed ideology?\n\nDictators are justified in that they know better than the misinformed unprepared people about how to rule a country. Wrong! Even if people are misinformed and unprepared, that is no justification for going against their decisions. Inform and prepare the people better, instead!"
"10","What were the Framers' intentions for the legislative branch of the American government.?","","The framer's of our constitution intentions was to have a cross section of the American people serving in the U.S. Congress.  What has happened is that you have to be rich in order to get elected therefore we are being represented by the top 2% of the government that gets the largest tax breaks.  Is anybody seeing a theme here.  We have both Liberal and Conservative Millionaires in this country and I find it very hard to believe that any rich person actually has the poor peoples needs at heart.  The reason that the Liberals are having so much trouble getting candidates elected these days is the fact that people are starting to see through this as well as the fact that the voter's that vote are actually more conservative.  For any election there are 40% of Voting Age Population not voting and no one knows where they stand except with the apathetic."

Military strikes, even limited, targeted and accurate ones, will have devastating consequences for the region and for the world.\n\nIf Iran gets safely and unmolested to nuclear status, it will be a threshold moment in the history of the world, up there with the Bolshevik Revolution and the coming of Hitler. \n\nAnd so we must ready ourselves for what may be the unthinkable necessity."

"3","What hepatitis c?","","Heptitis C is a disease of the liver, The hepatitis C virus (HCV) is one of the most important causes of chronic liver disease in the United States. It accounts for about 20 percent of acute viral hepatitis, 60 to 70 percent of chronic hepatitis, and 30 percent of cirrhosis, end-stage liver disease, and liver cancer. Almost 4 million Americans, or 1.8 percent of the U.S. population, have antibody to HCV (anti-HCV), indicating ongoing or previous infection with the virus. Hepatitis C causes an estimated 8,000 to 10,000 deaths annually in the United States.\n\nA distinct and major characteristic of hepatitis C is its tendency to cause chronic liver disease. At least 75 percent of patients with acute hepatitis C ultimately develop chronic infection, and most of these patients have accompanying chronic liver disease.\n\nChronic hepatitis C varies greatly in its course and outcome. At one end of the spectrum are patients who have no signs or symptoms of liver disease and completely normal levels of serum liver enzymes. Liver biopsy usually shows some degree of chronic hepatitis, but the degree of injury is usually mild, and the overall prognosis may be good. At the other end of the spectrum are patients with severe hepatitis C who have symptoms, HCV RNA in serum, and elevated serum liver enzymes, and who ultimately develop cirrhosis and end-stage liver disease. In the middle of the spectrum are many patients who have few or no symptoms, mild to moderate elevations in liver enzymes, and an uncertain prognosis. Researchers estimate that at least 20 percent of patients with chronic hepatitis C develop cirrhosis, a process that takes 10 to 20 years. After 20 to 40 years, a smaller percentage of patients with chronic disease develop liver cancer.\n\nChronic hepatitis C can cause cirrhosis, liver failure, and liver cancer. About 20 percent of patients develop cirrhosis within 10 to 20 years of the onset of infection. Liver failure from chronic hepatitis C is one of the most common reasons for liver transplants in the United States. Hepatitis C might be the most common cause of primary liver cancer in the developed world. In Italy, Spain, and Japan, at least half of liver cancers could be related to HCV. Men, alcoholics, patients with cirrhosis, people over age 40, and those infected for 20 to 40 years are more likely to develop HCV-related liver cancer.\n\nRisk Factors and Transmission\n\nHCV is spread primarily by contact with blood and blood products. Blood transfusions and the use of shared, unsterilized, or poorly sterilized needles and syringes have been the main causes of the spread of HCV in the United States. With the introduction in 1991 of routine blood screening for HCV antibody and improvements in the test in mid-1992, transfusion-related hepatitis C has virtually disappeared. At present, injection drug use is the most common risk factor for contracting the disease. However, many patients acquire hepatitis C without any known exposure to blood or to drug use.\n\nThe major high-risk groups for hepatitis C are:\n\nPeople who had blood transfusions before June 1992, when sensitive tests for anti-HCV were introduced for blood screening. \nPeople who have frequent exposure to blood products. These include patients with hemophilia, solid-organ transplants, chronic renal failure, or cancer requiring chemotherapy. \nHealth care workers who suffer needle-stick accidents \nInjection drug users, including those who used drugs briefly many years ago \nInfants born to HCV-infected mothers \nOther groups who appear to be at slightly increased risk for hepatitis C are:\n\nPeople with high-risk sexual behavior, multiple partners, and sexually transmitted diseases \nPeople who use cocaine, particularly with intranasal administration, using shared equipment \nMaternal-Infant Transmission\n\nMaternal-infant transmission is not common. In most studies, only 5 percent of infants born to infected women become infected. The disease in newborns is u"

"3","is there a cure for generll wartz?","","Genital Warts?\n\nHuman papillomavirus (HPV) is one of the most common causes of sexually transmitted infection (STI) in the world.  Some types of HPV cause genital warts—single or multiple bumps that appear in the genital areas of men and women including the vagina, cervix, vulva (area outside of the vagina), penis, and rectum. Genital warts (sometimes called condylomata acuminata or venereal warts) are the most easily recognized sign of genital HPV infection. Many people, however, have a genital HPV infection without genital warts. Genital warts are soft, moist, or flesh colored and appear in the genital area within weeks or months after infection. They sometimes appear in clusters that resemble cauliflower-like bumps, and are either raised or flat, small or large. Genital warts can show up in women on the vulva and cervix, and inside and surrounding the vagina and anus. In men, genital warts can appear on the scrotum or penis. There are cases where genital warts have been found on the thigh and groin. \n\nHPV has no known cure. There are treatments for genital warts, though they often disappear even without treatment. There is no way to predict whether the warts will grow or disappear. Therefore, if you suspect you have genital warts, you should be examined and treated, if necessary.\n\nDepending on factors such as the size and location of your genital warts, your health care provider will offer you one of several ways to treat them.\n\n• Imiquimod cream\n• 20 percent podophyllin antimitotic solution\n• 0.5 percent podofilox solution\n• 5 percent 5-fluorouracil cream\n• Trichloroacetic acid (TCA)\n\nIf you are pregnant, you should not use podophyllin or podofilox because they are absorbed by your skin and may cause birth defects in your baby. In addition, you should not use 5-fluorouracil cream if you are expecting.\n\nIf you have small warts, your health care provider can remove them by one of three methods.\n\n• freezing (cryosurgery)\n• burning (electrocautery)\n• laser treatment\n\nIf you have large warts that have not responded to other treatment, you may have to have surgery to remove them.\n\nSome health care providers use the antiviral drug alpha interferon, which they inject directly into the warts, to treat warts that have returned after removal by traditional means. The drug is expensive, however, and does not reduce the rate that the genital warts return.\n\nAlthough treatments can get rid of the warts, none get rid of the virus. Because the virus is still present in your body, warts often come back after treatment."

When they are burnt, combustion process, it is breakage of molecular state: to release atomic state (free radicles or ions). Afree radicle is a neutral atom with unpaired electrons. Like ions free radicles are also unstable and radily combine with another atom or ion to form a stable molecule. In combustion CO2, CO and H2O are main products besides other.

Yet, he defends the deal anyway.\n\nOk, Now choose:\nIs he irresponsible and greedy\nor, dumb and out of the loop.","His office is legally responsible for doing an in-depth security review of all major company sales by foreign businesses.  They review the deals to ensure there are no legal or security concerns before the deal is allowed to go through.  If they run into any concerns they can take steps to mitigate the risks (such as ensuring no one will be placed into sensitive areas, background checks, rescoping the contract, etc...)  This is naturally done in private since we are talking about security concerns and big business deals that can affect the stock of said companies.\n\nIt is possible that his staff reviewed the deal and gave the go-ahead without his direct involvement and he is merely saying he trusts his staff: heck, he did pick a bunch of people who think exactly like him.  Regardless, after reviewing the facts it sounds like opposing the deal would be akin to prejudice.\n\nWe can't stop foreign companies from controlling american interests.  The company that is trying to take control of the ports (they will not be providing security mind you) does an excellent and professional job of managing other ports around the world.\n\nOf course I do enjoy watching the republicans rip apart Bush on the issue.

Even if the other person has the virus, your unbroken skin is a good barrier. No one has become infected from such ordinary social contact as dry kisses, hugs, and handshakes. \n\nOpen-Mouth Kissing: \n\nOpen-mouth kissing is considered a very low-risk activity for the transmission of HIV. However, prolonged open-mouth kissing could damage the mouth or lips and allow HIV to pass from an infected person to a partner and then enter the body through cuts or sores in the mouth. Because of this possible risk, the CDC (Center for Disease Control) recommends against open-mouth kissing with an infected partner. \n\nOne case suggests that a woman became infected with HIV from her sex partner through exposure to contaminated blood during open-mouth kissing.\n\nAs far as oral sex, yes if there is an open wound in either place."

Comet Hale-Bopp is very unusual in that it has two tails instead of the normal one.\n\nComets are remnants of the formation of the universe billions of years ago.

"1","who realy created madi gras?","","Early Christians. The roots of Mardi Gras, Easter, and Christmas celebrations can be traced back to ancient Roman celebrations. As the Christian religion was forming, it was easier to bring converts from other religions if the major celebrations were kept intact, but given new Christian meanings. It is clear from the Bible that the Nativity didn't happen in winter (lambs aren't born then nor do shepherds tend them in the fields). The Roman feast of Saturnalia which included decorating with evergreen boughs and giving presents in an effort to entice the sun to return for another year was transformed into a celebration of the birth of Christ. The Roman feast of Oestre in the springtime, a celebration of fertility that included rabbits and eggs, was transformed by the Christians into Easter. \n\nLent is a 40 day period of abstinence prior to Easter. As one last blow-out, a celebration was held prior to the beginning of Lent. As the Lenten festival devloped over the centuries, it spread from 12th Night (supposedly the night the Wise Men arrived at Nazareth, actually the 12th night after Christmas) and lasted until Fat Tuesday, the day before the 40 days of Lent began.\n\n""Mardi Gras"" is French for Fat Tuesday. The festival has had other names in other languages. It cemented in our culture due to a 1699 French explorer who landed at a point in Louisiana on Fat Tuesday and named the place Point du Mardi Gras in honor of the celebration taking place in his native country."

"7","What does the term ""yankee"" mean, anyways?","","The term Yankee has a variety of meanings. Generally, it refers to citizens of the United States, particularly northerners, especially those Americans from the Northeastern United States.\n\nOrigins of the term are disputed. One theory customarily held by persons not from New England claims that it originated from the Dutch in old New Amsterdam (today known as New York City) in the Mid-Atlantic States. It then was adopted by the British as a pejorative for (Northern) colonists. The origin might have been the phrase Jan Kees (""John Cornelius"") (two very common Dutch names), which the English-speaking people picked up as ""yankees"", a word they used to refer to the Dutch.\n\nThe Dutch theory is somewhat confused. The settlers of New Amsterdam and the settlers of Massachusetts Bay were totally unconnected and did not come into contact until both communities were sufficiently dense to carry on trade up and down the East Coast. There is no reason why the British should call English settlers in a different location by a Dutch name when New Amsterdam was under Dutch jurisdiction and always had been. Moreover, New York has never been ""Yankee"" except in the world wars of modern times.\n\nThe prevalent theory in New England holds that it originated among a group of Indigenous peoples of the Americas on the East Coast of the United States. They were unable to pronounce the word ""English"", rendering it as ""yengis"" or ""yengeese"". This later was Anglicized to ""Yankees"".\n\nThis theory is widely held, as descendants of those same Native Americans are alive in Massachusetts, mainly as the Wampanoags and are vociferous about their origin and are fairly well publicized. They still know the basic core of their former language and are able to say that in it there is no ""l"" sound. Their ancestors would not have pronounced it, rendering English to ""yengis"".\n\nIn another theory, Indians who first learned of the English from the French may have borrowed the French language name ""Anglais"" and rendered it as something that approximated ""Yankee"" in their own phonetic system. One area in which French, French-allied Indians, and British-descended Americans would have come into contact was the area of frontier warfare conducted during the French and Indian War (1754–1763). This is more or less consistent with the areas in which other derivations of the word would postulate its first use. If this is the origin of the term Yankee, it may originally have had a pejorative, anti-American connotation similar to that of gringo, becoming adopted as a matter of pride by British-descended Americans who had fought on the frontier during the French and Indian War.\n\nThere are several other folk and humorous etymologies for the word.\n\nOne influence on the use of the term throughout the years has been the song Yankee Doodle, which was popular at the time of the American Revolutionary War (1775–1783). Though the British intended to insult the colonials with the song, following the Battle of Concord, it was adopted by Americans as a proud retort and today is the state song of Connecticut.\n\nAn early use of the term outside the United States was in the creation of Sam Slick, the ""Yankee Clockmaker"", in a column in a newspaper in Halifax, Nova Scotia, in 1835. The character was a plain-talking American who served to mock both American and British North American customs of that era. The stories were published in a book titled The Clockmaker, in 1836. The book was popular in British North America, the United States, and the United Kingdom."

"1","We all know that a Virgin girl can get pregnant. so How do we know that this was not the case with Virgin Mary","besdies anyone checked that was reall Virgin?","The purpose of the Virgin Birth story in regards to Jesus was to give him a miracle birth like all the other dying/saving  man/gods of the ancient world. Many of them were born of a human mother and a god for a father. Even Hercules had a human mother, Elcmene, and Zeus for a father. Dionysus had Semele for his human mother and, again, Zeus for his father, and the death of Dionysus was seen by his follers as dying for their sins.\n\nWhat everyone forgets is that IF Jesus was born of a virgin, then he cannot trace his lineage back to King David, and he therefore could not have been the Messiah! Some might say that this was to prevent him from being a descendant of Jehoikim, Jeconiah, or Shealtiel whose descendants, like Joseph, were cursed and would preclude a descendant of them from being the Messiah. But you cant have your cake and eat it too. He cant get the benefit from being a descendant of David through Joseph, without the curse that comes from being a descendant of those three, if he is to claim being from the House of David through Joseph.\n\nFurthermore, the Bible makes it clear that the Real Messiah is not adopted into the Davidic Line, but must be a direct bloodline descendant through his own human father back to King David, through Solomon.\n\nAnd if one were to actually pick up the Bible and read it, one would see that every single genealogy in the Bible traces the lineage through the father. If a mother is mentioned it is because she was famous, but the lineage still goes through her husband and not her. This is also true in the Christians' New Testament, where both Matthew and Luke trace Jesus's lineage through the males. This means that even if Mary was a descendant of King David, it would not matter because one's lineage is traced through one's father, not one's mother."

"2","Altitude of noon sun during the four different seasons of the year?","in Equator?\nTropic of Cancer?\nTropic of Capricorn?\nDana Point?","The position of the noon Sun varies throughout the year.  During the summer months it can be located as much as 23.5 degrees above (or north of ) the celestial equator and in winter the same angle below (or south of) the celestial equator.  \n\nFirst you have to know the latitude of each of these places to find out the position of the celestial equator in the sky.  \n\nLatitudes\nEquator = 0 degrees\nTropic of Cancer = 23.5 N\nTropic of Capricorn = 23.5 S \nDana Point, CA = about 34 N\n\nSo the altitudes of the celestial equator at these positions is 90 minus latitude.\n\nAltitude of celestial equators\nEquator = 90 degrees\nTropic of Cancer = 66.5 from south horizon\nTropic of Capricorn = 66.5 from north horizon \nDana Point, CA = about 56 degrees from south horizon\n\nOn the vernal and autumnal equinoxes the position of the noon Sun is on the celestial equator.  So just look at the above list to read off the altitude.\n\nOn the summer (winter) solstice the position of the noon Sun is 23.5 north (south) of the celstial equator.  So just add or subtract 23.5 degrees from the list above of altitudes.  For example Dana point:\n\nAltitude of noon Sun on the first day of \nSpring = 56 degress from south horizon\nSummer = 79.5 (56+23.5) degress from south horizon\nAutumn = 56 degress from south horizon\nWinter = 32.5 (56-23.5) degress from south horizon\n\nHope that was clear"

A male turkey will try to find a female flock to make his harem.\n\nTo attract females, the male will gobble and strut, fanning out his tail. He will mate with several females in the flock.\n\nWild Turkey nests are made in the ground. A shallow depression is lined with leaves and covered up with vines and other plants. Ten to fifteen eggs are laid. Eggs are light brown, with black and dark brown spots. The female will sit on the eggs for a month are more. This makes her very vulnerable to predators."

"4","In Martin Luther King's ""I Have a Dream,"" what does it mean, a ""rude awakening?""?","----------------------------------------------------------\nIt would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment and to underestimate the determination of the Negro. This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality. 1963 is not an end, but a beginning. Those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual. There will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights. The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.\n----------------------------------------------------------\nParagraph 5 of ""I Have a Dream"" by Martin Luther King Jr.\nin MODELS FOR WRITERS\nWhat does it mean, a ""rude awakening?""","Generally, when we sleep, we sleep at nearly perfect peace.  Our bodies go into a state where our dreams take over our minds and we are unsure what is real and what is a figment of our imaginations.  Our heart rates and our breathing are perfectly controlled. There is a sense that nothing can harm us.  Then, suddenly and without warning, something occurs in the real (external) world that is so loud or otherwise disconcerting that, rather than easing back into consciousness as we normally do (absent an alarm clock or wake-up call), we are shocked back into alertness.  The shock and fear and annoyance that we feel then is what Dr. King alluded to in his speech.  Those citizens who expected that civil rights activism was a ""phase"" and that the downtrodden would eventually lose interest in being treated as equals were going to eventually have to confront their own shock and fear and annoyance when they suddenly realized that their presumption was false.\n\nIt almost sounded as if Dr. King's words were intended as a thinly-veiled threat of physical violence which, if so, would be an ironic choice for someone intimately associated with non-violent change.  But I believe that he was actually illustrating that non-violent change should never be confused with complacent inaction.  In other words, although he would never have incited the people to use physical force to achieve any means, the sheer power of non-violence non-cooperation could have an explosive impact on the nation as a whole if the people's demands were not met.\n\nLanguage and allusion was all part of Dr. King's genius."

"5","what is the major diffrent between abstract class and interfaces?","","Choosing interfaces and abstract classes is not an either/or proposition. If you need to change your design, make it an interface. However, you may have abstract classes that provide some default behavior. Abstract classes are excellent candidates inside of application frameworks.\n\nAbstract classes let you define some behaviors; they force your subclasses to provide others. For example, if you have an application framework, an abstract class may provide default services such as event and message handling. Those services allow your application to plug in to your application framework. However, there is some application-specific functionality that only your application can perform. Such functionality might include startup and shutdown tasks, which are often application-dependent. So instead of trying to define that behavior itself, the abstract base class can declare abstract shutdown and startup methods. The base class knows that it needs those methods, but an abstract class lets your class admit that it doesn't know how to perform those actions; it only knows that it must initiate the actions. When it is time to start up, the abstract class can call the startup method. When the base class calls this method, Java calls the method defined by the child class.\n\nMany developers forget that a class that defines an abstract method can call that method as well. Abstract classes are an excellent way to create planned inheritance hierarchies. They're also a good choice for nonleaf classes in class hierarchies."

But my marriage - an arranged one in India- had been a mismatched and now a  disaster. Have two kids  who had kept us together. Have not made love with my wife for last five years though feel for it at times. Now I met a girl of 23 and have fallen in love with her as if I am once again 23 years old when I had my first love in life and  nothing of this kind till now. She also is in deep love wtih me  but because of  my  brillance and knowledge. Now we are very emotionally in love with each other. I told her of her future that our love holds for her.But she is only in love with me and nothing else. Will be meeting her on Sunday and do not know what to do. My heart say leave everything that is loveless and opt for the new one that is real life that I missed ever since I was 23 years old when I was in real love.","First let me say that I'm so sorry for the turmoil that is inside you. Love has no age, it's in the heart. However, you have children to consider. It's difficult to step back from a situation that consumes you. You have to ask yourself this question -- are you in love with this young woman, or are you swept away by the attention, devotion, respect, sex, etc. that you may be receiving from her? Does this young woman truly love you, or are you a wise, older, father figure for her? In ten years, will she have outgrown you and look for a younger man? Will you be hurt? She doesn't share the same wisdom and life experiences that you have. She has her entire life ahead of her. I'm not trying to negate your feelings, just am trying to tell you to look at it from all views. Another thing, show your wife the respect she deserves. She's the mother of your children and deserves your respect for that alone. Would she consider counseling? Is there anything left to salvage? Is there resentment or other issues that is the reason for the lack of sex? I would suggest that you slow down, do some serious evaluating of your own life, and perhaps seek counseling for yourself. Is your self-esteem shot? Please don't do anything rash, but if you both decide that you are truly in love for the long haul -- even when you're 74 and she's 43 -- I wish you happiness. Good luck with whatever you decide."

Here's how to get the answer.\n\nThe other way to say what this question is asking is this: If the school is 45% boys and 55% girls (which we know), then that means that the 858 girls are 55% of the total number in the school.\n\n""But,"" you say, ""55% of WHAT????""\n\nYou can compare it using a ratio: 858 over ""some magical unknown number"" is the same as 55 over 100. So MULTIPLY 858 by 100, and then divide the answer by 55. That means the ""magical unknown number"" turns out to be 1,560...that's how many students there are in the school.\n\nTake out the girls (858) from the total (1,560) and you get...702.

But sometimes I feel like I should forget about him and move with my life.","How can he be your ex if you two are still in love with each other?  If he really loves you there will be no excuse for being busy.  If he really wants to talk to you even if he is busy he will talk to you anyway.  I think you better make sure if he really loves you, baby.  You see, my husband has been working in a different country for quite a long time now but in 9 years that we've been together, believe it or not, he calls me every single day.  Not only that, in a single day he calls me not less than 3 times a day just to check if I have already eaten and many small thoughts that really counts.  He also e-mail me.

"3","What are the benefits of Stopping smoking marijuana?","I have been smoking pot every day for about ten years.  Part of the reason is that it helps with symptoms I have from having my colon removed a few years ago (such as diahrea).  I want to stop smoking because I think the pot may be interrupting my ability to concentrate during the day, even when I'm not high, or don't feel high.  But then again I wasn't good at concentrating even before I started smoking pot.  So I'm not sure stopping will help with that.","My husband and I have been smoking pot for about the same time you have. We have also thought about quitting but not too sure if it will make us better or not. Honestly, it cuts back on our smoking cigarettes and drinking so, I think we will keep smoking pot.

"2","extraterrestrial life and math?","Read this and tell me what you think\nI have to conclude that there probably is intelligent life out there, simply on a probability basis. Our galaxy contains some 200 billion stars. I'll make a conservative guess that on average, every star has, say, 3 planets around it. That puts us at 600,000,000,000 planets. We don't know how many galaxies there are for certain, but the lower estimates are around 200 billion, giving us 1.2 X 10^23, or 120,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets. Take off 3/4 (at a guess) to account for the number of planets that are gas giants, or are otherwise totally unsuitable for life, giving us 30,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 planets. So, if we have even a 1/100,000,000,000,000,000,000 chance, or .000000000000000000000001% chance of there being intelligent life on any given planet, we'd have 900 of them. I'd set the odds considerably higher than that, so I'd say odd are that there is Intelligent life out there.","I agree.. It's so arrogant of us to think that there isn't life in other planets."

After 3yrs you should be able to freely express your feelings with each other. Best thing to do is just tell her, don't worry about if it will hurt her, best thing to do is be honest.  It would hurt her more to stay because actions speak louder than words and soon your feelings will start to surface, so instead of putting her through all kinds of emotional abuse just tell her and then leave.  She'll later respect you for handling it like a man."

If you are a vegetarian it is hard to get enough biotin (primary source is meat), or if you have a typical american diet, you might be deficient in the other ones (best source is cruciferous (cabbage, broccoli) vegetables and dark green leafy vegetables).\n\n  For some unknown reason, shaving any part of the body other than the head seems to stimulate thick regrowth in both men and women.\n\n  Hope this helps!"

Warmer air can hold more moisture (measured in grains) than cold air. If you have 70 degree air at 90 percent humidity and the temperature suddenly dropped to 50 degrees, the humidity level would rise to 100 percent. This is called the saturation or dew point. when the humidity is at 100 percent the air can hold no more moisture and it begins to condensate (fog, dew, rain) until the relative humidity drops below 100 percent. When you wake up and it is foggy (air is at dewpoint) and in a while the sun warms the air and the fog clears, this is an example of a drop in relative humidity."

For those who are making less than that same level, they are comparing two different frames of reference.  It is easier for others to see it as 'unappreciated' while the person with that level of income may just see it as 'commonplace'.\n\nIt is almost like moving from a minimum-wage paying job to one that may pay 25k - 30k a year.  You will find yourself most likely spending your money to buy more items that you like, while those making minimum wage will have less.  You may become accustomed to those things and may not be as occupied with them, while others do not have them.  This may soon lead them to think that you do not appreciate the things that you have.\n\nPeople do tend to appreciate the things that they worked hard to attain, even if their attitude may suggest that they do not.  It is just that their lifestyle is in a different frame of reference."

"2","Why are the weather people always wrong? I mean they always forecast snow, alot of it, then we get none!?","","Depends on where you live and how large an area the forecast covers.  Forecasts are for large areas and within those areas are microclimates determined by geography such as mountains, passes, large bodies of water (oceans, lakes, bays), altitude, et cetera.\n\nWhen I was a kid in Pennsylvania, the snow would always track north or south of where we lived so while other schools would get snow days, we'd only get an hour or two of snow delay.\n\nI watch the weather forecasts in the Northern California Sierras these days.  Just travelling up and down the mountain and in and out of town can change how much snow I see.  Sometimes the forecasters call for snow and we don't get as much.\n\nThe computer models can only provide a probability of snow and not forecast exact amounts in any given location."

"2","Where's the best College of Engineering in the world?","","This is probably very hard to determine. You have to define the criteria for ""best"" first. Most famous graduates? Most successful graduates? Highest fraction of successful graduates? Biggest research grants? Most number of patents from faculty? Greatest number of publications per faculty member? \n\nInstitutions rise and fall with time. A very good school 100 years ago might not be so good now. And vice versa. And engineering is a broad discipline. What type of engineering? Some schools might be great in electrical engineering, and awful in mechanical engineering, or vice versa. And what exactly is engineering? Where is the boundary between engineering and chemistry, physics, applied mathematics, statistics, etc? Some schools might be great at practical engineering, but very weak in the theoretical aspects, and vice versa. The number of criteria one could consider could be very long, with hundreds or thousands of items. \n\nAnd even then, one would have a lot of disagreement. Even producing a list of the 100 best in the world would be quite challenging, and there would be lots of controversy."

"1","What is Shrove Tuesday?","I see signs up in our local Catholic churches for Shrove Tuesdays events around this time of year.  In the Catholic faith, what is this day and why is it celebrated?  I have a basic understanding of Catholic theology, so if you could explain it to me with that in mind, I'd really appreciate it. One small request, can we please keep the Catholic bashing out of this. It's a legitimate question and I'm only looking for an answer not reasons why it's wrong or right. Thanks!","Shrove Tuesday is the Tuesday before Ash Wednesday which is the first day of Lent. It's a day of penitence, to clean the soul, and a day of celebration as the last chance to feast before Lent begins.\n\nShrove Tuesday is probably the Christian festival that the family enjoys most, after Christmas, of course.\n\nBut there's more to Shrove Tuesday than pigging out on pancakes or taking part in a public pancake race. The pancakes themselves are part of an ancient custom with deeply religious roots. \n\nPenitence \nShrove Tuesday gets its name from the ritual of shriving that Christians used to undergo in the past. In shriving, a person confesses their sins and receives absolution for them.\n\nWhen a person receives absolution for their sins, they are forgiven for them and released from the guilt and pain that they have caused them.\n\nIn the Catholic or Orthodox context, the absolution is pronounced by a priest. \n\nThis tradition is very old. Over 1000 years ago a monk wrote in the Anglo-Saxon Ecclesiastical Institutes: \n\nIn the week immediately before Lent everyone shall go to his confessor and confess his deeds and the confessor shall so shrive him.\n\nShrove Tuesday celebrations \nShrove Tuesday is a day of celebration as well as penitence, because it's the last day before Lent. \n\nLent is a time of abstinence, of giving things up. So Shrove Tuesday is the last chance to indulge yourself, and to use up the foods that aren't allowed in Lent.\n\nGiving up foods: but not wasting them \nIn the old days there were many foods that observant Christians would not eat during Lent: foods such as meat and fish, fats, eggs, and milky foods.\n\nSo that no food was wasted, families would have a feast on the shriving Tuesday, and eat up all the foods that wouldn't last the forty days of Lent without going off.\n\nThe need to eat up the fats gave rise to the French name Mardi Gras; meaning fat tuesday. Pancakes became associated with Shrove Tuesday as they were a dish that could use up all the eggs, fats and milk in the house with just the addition of flour.\n\nThe origin of pancake racing \nPancake races are thought to have begun in 1445. A woman had lost track of the time on Shrove Tuesday, and was busy cooking pancakes in her kitchen.\n\nSuddenly she heard the church bell ringing to call the faithful to church for confession. The woman raced out of her house and ran all the way to church; still holding her frying pan and wearing her apron.\n\n\nGoing for gold in the pancake olympics \nOne of the most famous pancake races is held at Olney in Buckinghamshire over a 415 yard course. The rules are strict; contestants have to toss their pancake at both the start and the finish, as well as wearing an apron and a scarf. The race is followed by a church service.\n\nSince 1950 Olney has competed with Liberal in Kansas, which holds an identical race, to see which town can produce the fastest competitor. After the 2000 race, Liberal was leading with 26 wins to Olney's 24."

"7","How do interest only mortgages work and what is the catch?","have been quoted 7.25% on a 30-mortgage on a fixed rate basis. Also was quoted 6.375% on a 30-year interest only payment schedule. Although this reduces the monthly payment, how does this pay off a mortgage? Does this require additional payments to reduce the principal?","An interest only mortgage does exactly what it says - pays only the interest. For example a $100,000 loan @ 6% interest only for 30 years = a payment of $500. If you were paying a conventional 30 year mortgage the payment would be $600. 100 would go towards paying down the loan. The only way to pay down the mortgage is to pay extra each month or make and extra payment during the year. Now, I.O. (interest only) loan have a lot of benefit if you don't plan on staying in the house for a long time, for example and investor or someone looking to move in the future. The reason for this is because even though you are not paying down the mortgage you are still building equity on your house and only paying the minimum payment to stay in it till you sell it. Hope this helps."

A little bit probably wouldn't hurt someone with self-esteem issues, as many people with large noses, big stomachs, protruding chins and lopsided breasts STILL MANAGE TO GO THROUGH LIFE without going under the knife.  But, as shown on some of these ""investigative"" TV SHOWS, many people (especially women, who constitute the majority of candidates for surgery) tend to get ""addicted"" to the whole false idea of ""perfection"" through surgery.  Especially models, actresses, and just plain ""vain"" types (who actually aren't vain, again (in my opinion) just ""low self-esteem"" masquerading as ""beauty improvements"".  Why else do so many female candidates ""buy into"" this whole ""beauty myth"" trip ?"

I think the best thing you can do to court a girl is to give her flowers. A single red (or if you know her favorite color then use that) rose makes quite a statement. Have you told her you like her? Don't stress about it just be yourself and take it slow. Ask her out and when you pick her up have some flowers ready. If she likes stuffed animals you can give her little stuffed animals after you've had a couple of dates. It's really not hard. Don't buy her really expensive things untill you get very serious. Be polite and respectful and complement her on the things she wears and even her perfume if she wears any. After you get serious you can send flowers to her work or her school. Girls like public displays of affection. I hope that helps hun, and if it doesn't than there are plenty of other girls that will love it!"

"7","what is a virgin?","","In its most general sense, virginity is characterized by a state of unimpacted purity, usually stemming from a lack of experience (for example, newcomers to game Bingo could be referred to as virgins). Traditionally, virgin is used to describe a person who has not engaged in sexual intercourse. This use is traditionally restricted to a person who has not yet engaged in vaginal intercourse, but it is sometimes used to describe someone who has not engaged in sexual activities in general. Also, someone can be referred to as an ""anal virgin,"" being a virgin to anal sex (specifically receiving anal sex). The status of ""virginity"" is sometimes respected and valued in certain societies, especially in relation to views of many religions on sexual conduct before marriage. The term maiden is also sometimes used to mean a virgin, although that can also refer to an unmarried or merely young woman.\n\nBtw, some cultures and religions have slightly different meaning."

There is another kind of option in AI wherein both the egg and the sperm is harvested in both partners but a 3rd party will carry the baby if the female egg-donor is incapable of carrying the child herself.  \n\nOf course, adoption would be another option."

"6","i want know more for cf barcelona?","","In the late 1800's Hans Gamper and ten other enthusiasts were playing an unknown sport called 'foot-ball'. When Gamper went on to found Barcelona Football Club on 29 November 1899, he could hardly have imagined the momentous events that would follow!\n\nThroughout some of Catalonia's most difficult years, the flag represented the people's hopes for freedom, and today that very flag is the symbolic link which continues to represent the ties between a very special club and its' supporters.\n\nOver the course of 100 years, the club has lived through moments of glory and tragedy, through good times and bad, through epic victories and crushing defeats. Each one of these moments has contributed to shaping Barcelona into the absolutely unique club that it is today.\n\nBarcelona's renown can be attributed, in part, to impressive statistics but another factor is certainly that Barcelona is one of the most highly decorated teams in the world. With the exception of the International Cup, the showcases of the Barcelona museum contain every trophy possible. Topping off the impressive collection is the European Cup, the crowning glory of a Wembley final that went into the history books.\n\nQuite apart from winning the supreme continental prize, Barcelona is also in the extremely enviable position of being the only team in Europe to have participated in every European Cup since 1955 the first year the tournament began. Their massive European trophy collection also includes the Cup Winners' Cup, which the club has won no less than four times - making it undisputed king. In addition, Barca accumulated three Fairs Cups (nowadays know as the UEFA Cup) in the 1958, 1960 and 1966 seasons. The Club retained the trophy in perpetuity after winning a special final in 1971, which paired together the first winner of the competition, FC Barcelona, against the last winner, Leeds United. However, Barca does not just reign in Europe but also in Spain, specifically in the Kings Cup, leading the ranking of winners in this competition with 24 titles. \n\nOf course, Barcelona reigns in Spain as well as in Europe and no other Spanish team can equal Barcelona's 24 championship titles in the Copa del Rey.\n\nAs for the Spanish championship league (historically one of the toughest competition grounds for the club), Barcelona celebrates the centenary birthday with 16 league titles to its name. Six of these were amassed over the last ten years alone.\nBut most outstanding of all was that glorious night of May 20, 1992 at the legendary Wembley Stadium in London, when Barcelona beat Sampdoria 1-0 to win the European Cup. Ronald Koemans goal in the 112th-minute of the game now forms part of the Blaugrana legend and the side that featured in that historic match has gone down in gold letters in the clubs proud history: Zubizarreta, Nando, Ferrer, Koeman, Juan Carlos, Bakero, Salinas (Goikoetxea), Stoichkov, Laudrup, Guardiola (Alexanko) and Eusebio.\n\nThe last few years\n\nThe Cup Winners Cup, Spanish Cup and Spanish Super Cup won by English manager Bobby Robson's Barca in 96-97, the League and Cup double in 1998, and the League in 1998-99 (the first of Van Gaal's two periods in charge at the club) were the last major titles to be won by the FC Barcelona first team.\n\nAnother highly emotional occasion was the Club Centenary in 1999 (Antoni Tàpies designed the official poster), which served as a link between a glorious past and hope for continued success in the future. In its historic centenary year, Barcelona won the football, basketball, handball, and roller hockey leagues.\n\nOn July 23, 2000, Joan Gaspart took over the presidency of the club, and on January 22, 2002, work began on the 'Joan Gamper' training grounds in Sant Joan Despí. Another of the Club's proudest moments came on May 11, 2003, when the basketball team won the Euroleague for the first time ever. The final was played in the Palau Sant Jordi aga"

In a way, you gave power to her, and you kind of relinquished emotionally; you kind of put your life in her hands, and your self-worth upon her acceptance of you.\nThere's probably not much you can do about it now that everything happened.\nI say that retrospecting back to a similar, extremely traumatizing experience I had. I was in so much pain, for months. It was because I had invested my pride in her. That's always a mistake. You need to kind of ""carry your own pride"" and not expect your woman to hold all of it.\nWhat I refer to ""investing your pride"" is a process by which you try to come to terms with being with her. The first feeling is that you like her a lot, and in essence she becomes some type of possession or trophy, and she determines your social standing. Then a paradox happens: you think ""since she's so great, and she's with me, that means I'm great... no wait... I'm even greater than her""!. that's when things start falling apart. Too much of that, and then she leaves, and you're don't feel that great anymore.\nMaybe I'm like way off. This is just my guess.\nThe solution is to concentrate on your goals. read as many self-help books you can on goal setting and ""reaching your dreams"" and stuff. Audio books are even better, it's like listening to a friend trying to help. Good luck."
"4","how much does a ream of office paper weigh?","I need to convert ""paper"" usage at our location from a volume measure (number of railcars) to weight (per person per day) for purposes of illustration.","There are to many variables to answer absolutly, what weight of paper are you using? (20 pound, 25 pound, 18 pound), are you using A4 or standard US paper? glossy or matte finish?\n\nAll of these things are needed for an answer, but if I assume that you are using standard US 20 pound matte paper (like you buy for your office copy machine) then it weights roughly 6 pounds.  I will put the formula here later.  I have it at home (how strange is that?)\n\n** Edit **\n\nO.K.  I had the formula but now I don't.  Basically it is something like this:\n\nyou purchase 20 pound paper, well. . . that is the weight of 1,000 sheets of 11x17 (in the US) paper, also called the M Weight (M=1,000 cute, eh?).  Now, 1,000 sheets of 11x17 is 4 reams of 8.5x11 paper.\n\nSo 4 reams = 20 pounds then you divide it by 4 (20/4=5) so you have 5 pounds per ream.\n\nRemember that is for 20 pound white uncoated paper.  If you have colored paper or coated paper, it will change and you may not have 500 sheets in a ream. (some paper comes in 480 sheet reams)\n\nThis formula works for 24 pound, or 110 pound and anything in between.\n\nHope you have the info you need.  if you need more detail, let me know by leaving more in the question."

"2","the physics involved in motion of a car?","","A nice open question and so much to talk about! Where to begin???\n\nOk I'll talk about what happens when you drive away in a car. The acceleration needed for a car to move from standstill is proportional to the force applied (by the engine). While you have a force from the engine pushing the car forwards, there are always opposing forces - such as friction from the air, the axles and tyres. These reduce the amount by which the car accelerates away. When you pull away you start in 1st gear (usually). This is so that the car has enough power to pull away. A car could not pull away in its highest gear for example. This is because in a low gear, the input speed (from the engine) is converted into such a speed which allows the car to pull away. You can only go slowly in this gear, but at least you can pull away with plenty of power. For higher gears, your car will tend to be already in motion (i.e. it has momentum). It does not therefore require much power to allow an increase in speed. So high gears are good for high speeds, but the car finds it harder to pull away.\n\nWhen you are travelling at a constant speed, the forces are balanced, so the force that the engine applies is equal to the opposing forces such as friction. It is important to quote Newton's 1st law - a body will continue in uniform motion unless acted upon by an external force. This applies in the above situation but friction complicates the matter. Say there was no friction, then for the car to travel at constant speed, no force would need to be applied (ever) once it had reached that constant speed.\n\nIf you need to use the brakes to come to a stop, these use friction to slow you down. Typically disc brakes are connected to the wheel and pads press on the discs to slow the wheels (and therefore the car) down. The brakes use a hydraulic system which only needs the driver to apply a small pressure on the pedal for the pads to exert a larger pressure on the discs. This happens because the freedom of movement in the brake pedal is long, whereas it is small in the brake pads. This difference allows a much larger pressure to be applied to the brake discs. Also note that road surface conditions and tyre conditions have a considerable effect on the braking distance - ice and water increase braking distance considerably. Some cars use an anti-lock braking system which works by releasing the tyres when skidding is detected so that the tyre will gain grip followed by more braking. This technique helps to decrease braking distances. \n\nI could go on but I must stop now!"

Then show your education, work experience, any interests, achievements, and skill sets. Under your work experience, it is not a list of your job descriptions (this is a common mistake).

I know we need to set up board of directors, and by-laws, but what should I do to get the word out immediately and start managing any incoming donations?  This is my first time doing something like this so any input is greatly appreciated!!!!","Congrats on your new non-profit! Non profits are just like any business - you need to get the word out in order to get the needed funding to help support your activities. Here are some tips to help you market your non profit:\n\n1. Determine your your target audiences: who are the groups and audiences that your non profit wants to reach. Remember that one target group may respond differently to a marketing message as another group so make sure that each strategy is tailor made for each audience.\n\n2. Develop a communications strategy, creating timelines for marketing efforts such as newsletters, press releases, special events, and others.\n\n3. Develop a visual image. Prepare your logo and other branding tools - and use them consistently across various mediums. Make sure that you repeat your branding messages, slogans in everything you make from brochures to newsletters.\n\n4. Employ multiple communications tactics: Nonprofit organizations often target several audiences, which may respond to different approaches. Various communications campaigns can help establish and maintain a more widespread positive image.\n\n5. Select and use appropriate media: Plan to use a combination of approaches best suited to reaching your targeted audiences and that make best use of your financial resources. Include a variety of methods including phone calls, letters, e-mail, newsletters, PSAs, press releases, and editorials.\n\nI have found a website that compiles various resources on starting a non profit. I especially like the Minnesota Council of NonProfits because the site gives information on governance, developing strategic alliances, fund raising and other ingredients of successfully running a non profit."
"4","what are the common gestures that americans use when they greet each other?","for example types of handshake, nod head, patting on the back, bowing and etc","Well, handshakes are typical. Men and women shake hands with men and women; there are no gender differences. Usually people just grasp hands--there is no holding the other's elbow, or clasping two hands.\n\nYou may nod heads with someone you know as an acquaintance, for example, someone you recognize at work but do not have much contact with. This guesture may be accompanied with a greeting like, ""Hi!"" or ""Hey!""\n\nBack-patting from what I've seen is done only between men who know each other and often is a fatherly gesture.\n\nI never see bowing.\n\nIn my experience, hugging usually only occurs with family members or good friends."

I believe it is important to maintain a native language.  I also believe in our ability to learn other languages. In doing so, we open up so many other worlds too.  To me, it's not a choice of ""one or the other"". . .it's the choice to learn more than what I already know, and to nuture what I already have."

"2","What is the size of the plasmid DNA pCMV-GFP?","","Plasmid containing pCMV-GFP was propagated in transformed Escherichia coli cells. E coli cells were grown in standard Luria Bertani medium at pH 7.0 to a cell density of ~3 to 4 × 109 cells/mL. Cells were harvested by centrifugation and the plasmid DNA was extracted and purified using a Qiagen Plasmid Maxi Kit (Qiagen, Santa Clarita, CA) as per the manufacturer’s recommended protocols. In brief, the plasmid purification procedure involved alkaline hydrolysis of the cells and isolation of the plasmid by binding to an anion-exchange resin of proprietary composition. The concentration of the purified plasmid preparation was 0.87 µg/µL determined using a UV-visible spectrophotometer (SpectraMax Plus, Molecular Devices, Sunnyvale, CA) using OD260 (optical density at wavelength 260 nm). The OD260/OD280 ratio was 1.964, indicating that the plasmid preparation was sufficiently pure and could be used for transfection purposes. Standard agarose gel electrophoresis on a 0.8% wt/wt agarose gel was conducted to investigate the plasmid structural integrity and revealed 2 major bands. The high-mobility band was attributed to the most compact or supercoiled form of plasmid DNA. The other band with low mobility indicated the overall nonsupercoil content in the plasmid preparation.\n\nFormation of DNA-Anionic Liposome Complexes\n\nFor a single transfection experiment, 225 ng of DNA was diluted into a liposome suspension equivalent to 40 µg lipid in a centrifuge tube. Anionic lipoplex formation was achieved by addition of calcium chloride solution. Ca2+ ions were introduced into the formulation using stock solution of a 2 M calcium chloride solution that had been previously filter sterilized through a 0.2-µm filter. The amount of plasmid DNA was identical in all experiments irrespective of the Ca2+ concentrations (~7 mM to 132 mM) introduced into each complexation tube. The final volume of the lipoplex suspension applied to the cells was 300 µL. The complexes were incubated for 25 minutes at room temperature."

African American people are the least likely to have adequate health care and therefore not have knowledge of the transmission of the disease. It is also well documented that some AA men have at times engaged in high-risk sexual behavior with other HIV+ men (down-low) or with prostitutes. They then unknowingly bring the disease home to their GF/wife. There are many other factors that go into the descrepancy between the races but this seems to be the number one cause."

"1","can u please tell me the history of valentine day.?","","The first interpretation has this celebration originating as a pagan tradition in the third century. During this time hordes of hungry wolves roamed outside of Rome where shepherds kept their flocks. The God Lupercus, was said to watch over the shepherds and their flocks and keep them from the wolves. Every February the Romans celebrated a feast called Lupercalia to honor Lupercus so that no harm would come to the shepherds and their flocks. Also during Lupercalia, but in honor of the goddess Juno Februata, the names of young women were put into a box and names were drawn by lot. The boys and girls who were matched would be considered partners for the year, which began in March. This celebration continued long after wolves were a problem to Rome.\n\nAs Christianity became prevalent, priests attempted to replace old heathen practices. To Christianize the ancient pagan celebration of the Feast of Lubercus, the church officials changed the name to St. Valentine's Day. To give the celebration further meaning and eliminate pagan traditions, priests substituted the drawing of Saints names for the names of the girls. On St. Valentine's Day the priest placed saint's names into an urn or box. The young people then drew a name from the container. In the following year, the youth was supposed to emulate the life of the saint whose name he had drawn. \n\nBy the fourteenth century they reverted back to the use of girl's names. In the sixteenth century they once again tried to have saintly valentines but it was as unsuccessful as the first attempt.\n\nWhile it can't be proved historically, there were seven men named Valentine who were honored with feasts on February 14th. Of these men, two stories link incidents that could have given our present day meaning to St. Valentine's Day.\n\nOne of these men named Valentine was a priest during the reign of Emperor Claudius. Valentine was revered by the young and old, rich and poor, with people of all walks of life attending his services. At this time Emperor Claudius was heavily recruiting men to serve as soldiers for his wars without much success. The men preferred not to leave their wives, families and sweethearts to fight in foreign lands. Claudius became angry and declared that no more marriages could be performed and all engagements were cancelled.\n\nValentine thought this to be unfair and secretly married several couples. When Claudius found out, he threw Valentine in prison where he died. Friends of the priest retrieved his body and buried it in a churchyard in Rome.\n\nAnother version had St. Valentine jailed for helping Christians. While Valentine was in prison he cured a jailer's daughter of blindness. Claudius became enraged and had Valentine clubbed and beheaded on February 14, 269 A.D. \n\nYet another story claims that Valentine fell in love with the jailer's daughter and wrote her letters that were signed ""From your Valentine.""\n\nAll of the seven Valentines eventually evolved into one. In 496 Pope Gelasius declared the day in honor of St. Valentine. Through the centuries the Christian holiday became a time to exchange love messages and St. Valentine became the patron saint of lovers. Lovers' quarrels come under his jurisdiction and, naturally, he is the patron saint of engaged couples and of anyone wishing to marry. \n\n:-)"

"2","explain the four major concepts that comprise Dalton's Atomic Theory and explain the one idea which has change","","Democritus first suggested the existence of the atom but it took almost two millennia before the atom was placed on a solid foothold as a fundamental chemical object by John Dalton (1766-1844). Although two centuries old, Dalton's atomic theory remains valid in modern chemical thought.    Dalton's Atomic Theory:\n\n1) All matter is made of atoms. Atoms are indivisible and indestructible.\n\n2) All atoms of a given element are identical in mass and properties\n\n3) Compounds are formed by a combination of two or more different kinds of atoms.\n\n4) A chemical reaction is a rearrangement of atoms. \n \n\n\nModern atomic theory is, of course, a little more involved than Dalton's theory but the essence of Dalton's theory remains valid. Today we know that atoms can be destroyed via nuclear reactions but not by chemical reactions. Also, there are different kinds of atoms (differing by their masses) within an element that are known as ""isotopes"", but isotopes of an element have the same chemical properties.\n\nMany heretofore unexplained chemical phenomena were quickly explained by Dalton with his theory. Dalton's theory quickly became the theoretical foundation in chemistry."

"7","where does sodium erythorbate come from?","","SODIUM ERYTHORBATE IS PRODUCED BY FERMENTATION OF CORN SUGAR.\nSodium erythorbate is NOT made from earthworms. This was a popular rumor.\n\nSodium erythorbate is an antioxidant which can be used in various food systems: e.g. meat, fish, beverages, fruit and vegetables, etc. Chemically, it is the sodium salt of erythorbic acid which is recognized as GRAS by the US Food and Drug Administration. It is an epimer (structural mirror image) of sodium ascorbate and is identical in antioxidant effect.\n\nEribate® brand sodium erythorbate is produced by fermentation of corn sugar to meet the specifications outlined in the Food Chemicals Codex (F.C.C.). Eribate® is proven nontoxic in all applications.\n\nSodium erythorbate may be used to preserve freshness in fruit and vegetables. It does this by preventing discoloration and development of off-flavors.\n\nSodium erythorbate serves as an inhibitor of enzymatic browning by scavenging oxygen and by reducing quinones back to polyphenol compounds before they can undergo the reactions to produce brown pigments. Fruit and vegetables can be protected by spraying or dipping them in an aqueous solution of sodium erythorbate. \n\n\n\nErythorbic acid and sodium erythorbate are chemical isomers of ascorbates, they are effective antioxidants for applications that do not require a nutritional claim for vitamin activity. The efficiency of erythorbates as antioxidants depends upon the particular food system, the compounds to be protected, the amount of metal contamination, and the amount of oxygen to be removed form the system. Sodium erythorbate is not fat soluble and is most useful as antioxidant in aqueous systems. Erythorbic acid and sodium erythorbate are permitted food ingredients in the U.S. Japan and European Union."

He has been injury free for a while but you never know. And right now Pujols has been really injury free."

"9","Bi-Sexual Affair?","Okay, well.. First off i'm gay. I met this guy online, our personalities clicked, and we've grown very close. Well, One night I decided to sneak out and meet him. We drove to his place, got drunk, and things lead from there. Afterwards, we were talking and he said he was really Bi-Sexual and he had a girlfriend who lived in the next town. What am I supposed to do? I have him on Block on AOL until I figure this out... I figure he has to choose one or the other, and i'm depressed about being involved in an affair. I really care alot about this person, but I can't continue with him until this is solved. Is Bi-Sexuality an excuse to cheat?  Any advice?","I'm bisexual myself, and have had serious relationships with both men and women.  I've explained to many people in the past the inherent difficulty that bisexuals may have in monogomy.  The closest metaphor I have come up with is this...If you had to live the rest of your life and only could have oral relations, and no penetrative relations, would you be able to make due with that?  Monogomy for a bisexual is like that...effectively cutting off half of their sexual interest.  It can be done, of course...but it's not their 'natural' way of being.\n\nI'm not saying this means that your friend is allowed to cheat on his girlfriend...honesty is the cornerstone of any relationship.  But you'd be surprised how many wives/girlfriends are aware of and accept a man who has the need to express their sexuality.  How he and his girlfriend make their choices is not really something that you need to expend a lot of energy trying to worry about.\n\nThe main concern I have is that you seem to imply that you and your friend are getting more serious than simply recreational activity.  If he is in a relationship and is still seeking another relationship on the side, this goes more to his character than his sexual orientation, and ending the whole thing is a very good idea."

"3","Sneezing reaction?","The majority of time, after dining out at a restaurant when I am\n\nfinished with my meal I have a sneezing attack.  Most of the time the\n\nsneezing attack occurs once I have left the restaurant but not all the\n\ntime.  There is no common denominator in the type of food I am eating.\n\n I would say that the majority of the time I consume a couple of\n\nalcoholic beverages but that could be wine, beer or mixed drinks. \n\nThis occurs in smoking as well as non-smoking restaurants.  These\n\nsneezing attacks do not occur at home, even if I have a drink so I do\n\nnot believe it to be the alchohol.  Again, the common themes are\n\nRestaurant dining, alchohol and more times than not, once I hit the\n\noutside air, but not always.\n\nI am trying to figure out what if anything is causing this reaction.","sounds psycological.  Try not leaving the restaurant.  Try hiding in one of the bathroom stalls until all the employees leave for the evening and then crash on one of the booths.  If the sneezing re-occurs when the employees (or cops) wake you up the next day, seek medical attention."

"2","How is the freezing point specifically determined from a cooling curve?","","The freezing point of a pure substance can be derived from a cooling curve plotting the temperature versus time.\n\nAs energy is taken out of a liquid, its temperature falls.  When the temperature reaches the freezing point of the substance, energy is taken out, but the temperature remains constant.  At this point, the cooling curve levels out this is quite evident when looking at the graph.\n\nThis leveling off effect is seen because in order for the substance to free, additional energy must be removed from the liquid, this is called the latent heat of fusion.  After the substance is frozen, the temperature of the solid can continue to drop.\n{this same effect can also be seen as something melt, boils, condenses, or sublimes}"

One is limiting the amount of fluid intake before bedtime, another is establishing a pattern of using the bathroom right before bedtime regularly.\n\nIn some cases, the child may be a very sound sleeper and they make some devices that can be used to sound an alarm at signs of moisture.\n\nPossible causes to this problem could be physiological, such as slow development or some type of blockage of the nerves that sense a full bladder, although sometimes the cause can be psychological too, caused by a major change in a child's life.  (Such as moving to a new home, switching schools, divorce or death in the family, etc.)\n\nIf limiting fluids and establishing a pattern don't seem to work, you should consult the family physician for further guidance."

Thanks.","final drive for a 2000 is 4.4:1....this is on the type R heres some info\n\nSo how do we make a car that has a motor putting out such weak torque faster? That's when gears come in. Gears will multiply the torque by certain factors depending on their size/teeth count. Take a GS-R in first gear (3.23), when the motor spins 3.23 times, the driveshaft will turn once. And for every 4.4 turns of the driveshaft, the differential (final drive, 4.4) will turn once. That is directly connected to the axles which turn the wheels. You can simply multiply 3.23*4.4 to get an absolute gear ratio of 14.212:1. This means for every 14.212 turns of the motor the wheels will turn once. So if the motor gets to turn 14.212 times in order to only turn the wheels once, the amount of torque the motor is applying to the wheels gets multiplied that many times.\n\nif you were also asking for the 91 i dont have that info"

In medical transcription you have the choice of:\n\n1) Contracting with one of the many companies that will send you the work via a secured connection (high speed internet), you do process the work, send it back to them as directed and then you will be paid for the completed work.\n\n2) You can start your own medical transcription business, find your own clients to work with, process their workload and then get paid for the services that you rendered.\n\nIn medical billing there aren’t any legitimate companies that I know of that will hire or contract you to process their medical claims for them so the only option that you have is to start your own home based medical billing business/service.\n\nI do both medical billing and transcription from home and I own the businesses. I have never contracted with other companies to process their work because to me it’s just like working as an employee and we all know that to become financially secure you have to be owner of a thriving business not the hired help.\n\nThere are two resources that you should read because they are by experts within each field: \n\n1) ""Step-By-Step Guide To Medical Transcription At Home"". Michele Miller wrote this book and her advice can be found on every reputable medical transcription message board and forums. She has been in the business for years and is an expert on the topic of how to get involved in this industry so visit http://stelopm.mml461.hop.clickbank.net \n\n2) “Medical Billing Book For Beginners”.

"6","what is offences system of basketball ?","","First of all, it isn't OFFENCES, it's offense. Now, I don't understand what you're asking, but here you go:\n.\n.\n.\n.\nAlthough the rules do not specify any positions whatsoever, they have evolved as part of basketball. During the first five decades of basketball's evolution, two guards, two forwards, and one center were used. Since the 1980s, more specific positions have evolved, namely point guard, shooting guard, small forward, power forward and center. On some occasions, teams will choose to use a three guard offense, replacing one of the forwards or the center with a third guard.\n\nTwo main defense concepts are used: zone defense and man-to-man defense. Zone defense involves players in defensive positions, guarding whichever opponent is in their zone. In man-to-man defense, each defensive player guards and follows a specific opponent and tries to prevent him from taking action. Variations of these two main structures are used.\n\nOffensive plays are more varied, normally involving planned passes and movement by players without the ball. A quick movement by an offensive player without the ball to gain an advantageous position is a cut. A legal attempt by an offensive player to stop an opponent marking a teammate, by standing in the defender's way such that the teammate cuts next to him, is a screen or pick. The two plays are combined in the pick and roll, in which a player sets a pick and then ""rolls"" away from the pick towards the basket. Screens and cuts are very important in offensive plays; these allow the quick passes and teamwork which can lead to a successful basket. Teams almost always have several offensive plays planned to ensure their movement is not predictable. On court, the point guard is generally responsible for indicating which play will occur.\n\nDefensive and offensive structures, and positions, are more emphasised in higher levels in basketball; it is these that a coach normally requests a time-out to discuss.\n\n\nShooting\n \nPlayer releases a short jump shot, while her defender is either knocked down, or trying to ""take a charge.""Shooting is the act of attempting to score points by throwing the ball through the basket. While methods can vary with players and situations, the most common technique can be outlined here.\n\nThe player holds the ball to rest in the dominant hand's fingertips (the shooting arm) slightly above the head, with the other hand on the side of the ball. The ball is shot by extending the shooting arm to become straight; the ball rolls off the finger tips while the wrist completes a full downward flex motion. Generally, the non-shooting arm is only used to guide the shot, not to power it.\n\nPlayers often try to put a steady backspin on the ball to deaden its impact with the rim. The ideal trajectory of the shot is somewhat arguable, but generally coaches will profess proper arch. Most players shoot directly into the basket, but in certain situations the shooter may use the backboard to redirect the ball into the basket.\n\nThe two most common shots are the set shot and the jump shot. The set shot is taken from a standing position, with neither foot leaving the floor, typically used for free throws. The jump shot is taken while in mid-air, near the top of the jump. This provides much greater power and range, and it also allows the player to elevate over the defender.\n\nThe best shooters have good coordination, balance, courage and are well practiced. Realizing a shooting opportunity and using it is as important as basic technique; top players at the professional level rarely miss when given an unguarded look at the basket.\n\n\nPassing\n \nCarlos Arroyo shown here with the Utah Jazz, left, passes to a teammate.A pass is a method of moving the ball between players. Most passes are accompanied by a step forward to increase power and are followed through with the hands to ensure accuracy.\n\nOne of the most basic passes is the chest "

I could sell my house and pay everything off, but I don't know if I could get a apartment because of my credit. I could start a payment schedule and fix my credit rating over time. Which is better getting out of debt or fixing my credit rating? And what is the best way to check a credit rating?","I would definately not sell your home.  Especially if you already have a lot of equity in it.\n\nI wish I had more info.\n\nOK, lets assume you have a some equity in your home, and you have a decent job.  You ran up a lot of money in credit cards.  By the time you finish paying your utility bills and other expenses you don't have enough for payments on your cards.  I bet you have been making minimum payments too, right?\n\nI would not refinance your home unless the interest rate is high.  I'd suggest getting a home equity loan.  That way you roll all your payments into one, and you can write off the interest on your taxes.\n\nBut be warned!!!!  You must get control of your spending and quit using credit cards.  This is the trap that thousands of people have fallen into, and end up filing for bankruptcy.  \n\nThe new bankruptcy laws are a lot worse, and will cost you more. \n\nNow, if you don't have much equity, how is going to sell your home going to pay off your credit cards?  By the time you sell it and pay off the existing mortgage, you won't have anything left to start over with, let alone pay off credit cards.  In this situation you may want to look at going Chapter 7 (if you qualify).  \n\nGood luck"

"10","Where does it stop?","I am in the military.  To my understanding, I am payed by taxpayers. Well, I pay the same taxes. So why do I help pay my own salary? To my knowledge, taxes pay for streets. So why do I pay to park on the streets I already helped pay for? Where does it stop? \n\nThe military should be exempt from taxes anyway, seeing as we are the most under paid and over worked career field. I know I chose to join the military so please no cheap shots. I don't regret being in the military. I just think we deserve more than just the occasional 5-10% discount we sometimes get. Considering it is the military that keeps us all safe. Enough about the military because that will just start a bunch of anti war this and that stuff. I don't choose the battles. I just defend freedom.\n \nI really just want an answer to the street question. Before I joined the military, I thought about how we all pay for the construction of our streets. So why in the heck do we pay to park on them?","First, thanks for your service. You are a great American.\n\nI see where you're coming from with the Parking Meter thing. Yes, part of your tax dollars went to pay for the streets, but not all streets have parking meters/permits. Some are free to park on, some it is illegal to park on.\n\nBy making people buy permits to park on a particular street or neighborhood the local government might be trying to serve the residents of that neighborhood by limiting who parks on the street. By putting up parking meters, a city government might be trying to help local merchants by forcing a turnover of parking spots so that more customers can find parking.\n\nThere can be lots of reasons for local governments to do such things, not the least of which is to generate additional revenue to pay for city services. The real disgrace comes when the local governments are inept or corrupt and do not spend our money wisely."
"10","why are americans so unbelievably ignorant about other countries?","","I've thought about this one for years.\n\nMy theory is that, for the most part, especially those outside of major cities, Americans don't have to worry about other countries. Who is on our border? Canada? They're Americans! Mexico? They just send over tons of illegals! (Note: I personally don't think those last two things.) \n\nThe rest of the world seems far away and not terribly relevant. And, to be honest, for most Americans that is probably fairly accurate. Unless a local factory is moved to South Korea, why would anyone be concerned about South Korea?\n\nThis contrasts with other countries which are constantly reminded of the rest of the world. Small countries - like say the Baltic States - in particular have very good reasons for wondering if their big neighbors will plow through them. Even major European countries - Germany, Poland, France - are constantly reminded of their neighbors on TV, radio etc.\n\nThis sometimes leads to silly reactions in the US like ""France is a traitor."" Well, even if you think French policies hurt the US, France is still a western democracy and in NATO (more or less). Sometimes it seems that people are equating France with the Soviet Union. Get some perspective people!\n\nBack to the media point, American TV shows and movies are major exports around the world. Everyone gets a chance to see us (to the extent that Desperate Housewives and Charlie's Angels represent us). But how often do foreign shows end up in the US? Sure the British will show up on PBS, but more likely foreign shows are Americanized - from Big Brother to the Office. They even tried an American version of Faulty Towers once! (Staring Bea Arthur, forget the name of the show, it stunk and was quickly canceled.)\n\nOn top of this is the American ideal that we are the beacon of democracy in the world. In many respects this has been a good thing (Marshall Plan) but in other more recent foreign policy adventures - which shall remain nameless - it hasn't worked out so well. I think this gives us a superiority complex. And the worst part about it is, we have a pretty darn good country over all (there are major issues) and so that opinion isn't ridicilous.\n\nSo, basically I think it is because we are a big country, relatively isolated by geography, we have a superiority complex, and that we export culture, so most Americans don't need to know - and so don't care too much - about the rest of the world."

"6","What are the rules in Tennis for options during the coin toss?","I am interested in finding this portion of the official rules and regulations governing this aspect of a tennis match.","Since you alreay know how to use a computer, I'm very surprised you haven't used a search engine like Google or Yahoo to locate the Official Rules of Tennis online, and answer this question yourself.\n\nIf you have further questions about tennis rules, you should find it helpful to visit the USTA's (United States Tennis Association) website.\n\nHERE IS THE ANSWER TO YOUR QUESTION - - - -\n\nThe Official Rules of Tennis give the following 3 options to the coin toss (or racquet spin):\n\n1. Choice of Serving or Receiving -\n\nIt's considered an advantage to serve first because a speedy ball is difficult for an opponent to return.\n\nIf you have a consistent and fast and/or tricky serve, which makes you more likely to win the opening game of the match, then definitely serve first because you gain the psychological advantage of holding serve.\n\nIf you have a weak serve, and are more likely to lose the opening game of the match, which is a definite psychological disadvantage, then definitely receive first.\n\n2. Choice of Side -\n\nOften, the choice of side makes no difference. In fact, if you're playing tennis indoors, there's generally no difference at all because there are no climatic conditions to affect your match.\n\nHowever, it is possible, although quite atypical, that there are other factors to influence your decision. This could include having something in the background behind the baseline that makes it difficult to see the ball well.\n\nMost of the time, a meaningful difference occurs when you're playing tennis outdoors and unfavorable weather conditions warrant making a choice.\n\nOne unfavorable condition is having the sun low in the sky and shining in your eyes, making it difficult for you to see. In this case, it's best to choose the side not facing the sun, even if it means relinquishing your serve to your opponent. After all, you wouldn't want to lose the psychological advantage of winning the opening game.\n\nAnother unfavorable condition occurs when the wind is blowing so strongly that it makes it difficult to keep the ball in. Unfortunately, there are many differing opinions on what to do in this case.\n\nIn my opinion, if you're good at generating topspin, I'd say it would be best to have the wind at your back, thereby giving you extra speed on both your serve and groundstrokes.\n\n3. Choice given to Opponent -\n\nMost tennis players don't actually know the Official Rules of Tennis and, therefore, aren't aware of this choice.\n\nI'm a decisive person, so I always prefer to make a choice when it's warranted. If making a choice isn't truly warranted, then don't worry... it doesn't matter anyway!\n\nSPECIAL NOTE #1: Please don't make the mistake of combining Choices 1 and 2. The two choices are kept completely separate because it would be completely unfair to choose to serve with the wind behind you.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE #2: Don't worry about making a mistake when it comes to making a choice. After all, tennis players change sides every other game which tends to even things out. In fact, it's only the opening game that's affected by the choices. Still, in the case of a hotly contested match between players of more or less equal skills, this could make a difference.\n\nSPECIAL NOTE #3: It's a very sad fact that the vast majority of tennis players haven't read the Official Rules of Tennis and, therefore, make mistakes about the rules more often than not.\n\nDo yourself a favor... Read the rules!"
"3","Does postnasal drip cause bad breath? If what doctor can assist with this problem?","","Yes, postnasal drip can cause bad breath. \n\nI would first recommend an over-the-counter saline solution or an antihistamine (if your postnasal drip is caused by allergies). \n\nIf this condition continues for a prolonged period, you should see a doctor. This could be a sign of a bacterial sinus infection. In this case, a doctor could easily prescribe antibiotics to alleviate the problem."
"7","Should I apoogize to my boss, even if I feel I have nothing to apologize about?","My boss and I have a mother/daughter kind of relationship. However, all of a sudden she suspends me for a day because she feels like I got smart or ""loud"" with her. I talk to her that way all the time and she has never gotten upset about it. Now i'm wondering if I should apologize.","First, you must realize that she has placed herself in a position were she is not only your boss but also your friend. She still has to maintain a certain level of authority over you and that requires her to reprimand you.  You should discuss with her your confusion as to her sudden change in tone when this has been a common scenerio between the two of you.  She may have just had a bad day and your comment was ""the straw that broke the camels back"", and she may apologize first! Other than that you need to discuss with her your limitations in this area. You need to understand that just because you are friends you can't use that to your advantage, nor be angry with her when she has to do her job.  You are the employee and she is your superior. As hard as that is to deal with, you must. Talk to her on nuetral ground (home, dinner, etc.) If you discuss this with her at work, she is still in the authority mode. Good luck!"

"10","Does anyone else think that going to war for oil is actually worth it in the long run?","What I mean is, without oil, factories couldn't run, all forms of transportation would grind to a halt, and almost nobody would even be able to heat their homes in the winter. The entire economy and all quality of life would go down the toilet, and would drag the entire world economy down with it. So isn't going to war to secure a steady supply of oil actually worth the cost?","Difficult question you post that could cause many to drop down a ""knee jerk"" answer.  First of course everyone will say that human life is of more value than any natural resource.  But think of all the people who'd die of cold in the winter without oil.  And the economics of high priced oil can leave millions out of work and in some really dire circumstances.  However it's the ""in the long run"" portion of your question that makes me say that war for oil is not worth it.  The correct thing to do, and I believe this with every fiber in my being, is to find ways around the problem of oil.  Capitalism is suppose to be the perfect system where if a resource is not quite as abundant as one would hope, and therefore more expensive, then the market will find a way around it.  New energies, conservation, etc.  The fact that the powerful in business and politics right now don't want to ""waste"" their money researching these things and would rather ride on others backs to fight for cheaper oil is idiotic.  \nOn the bright side, the President mentioned this exact idea in his State of the Union Address.  Whether it was simple lip service or not remains to be seen."

"4","""A person is innocent unless proven guilty of a crime"" Is this argumentum ad ignorantiam?","","No; the failure of a court system to convict a person does not logically imply that a person is truly innocent of the crime.  By the same token, the success of a court to convice someone does not logically imply that a person is truly guilty of the crime.  The courts do not seek to fully and logically prove things, only to establish them beyond reasonable doubt.\n\nSo, if the system is reasonably sure a person is guilty, they are punished.  If the system is reasonably sure a person is innocent, they are not punished.\n\nThe statement ""innocent until proven guilty"" simply defines the algorithm the government will follow in the case that it is not possible to reasonably determine whether a person is guilty or innocent.\n\nThe law isn't about strict logic as no empirical science can be, but is rather about fair and effective implementation of the law."

The king is never actually captured—the game ends as soon as the king is checkmated. A player who is checkmated loses the game. Delivering checkmate is the ultimate goal in chess (although not all games end in checkmate often a player resigns before checkmate is administered, or the game may end in a draw in several ways)."

The purpose is to teach YOU to think and analyze.\n\nThe grand irony here is that TPCASTT is a formula and as Robert Frost wrote:\n\n>>\nYou get more credit for thinking if you restate formulae or cite cases that fall in easily under formulae, but all the fun is outside saying things that suggest formulae that won't formulate - that almost but don't quite formulate.\n>>"
"1","Why do so many athiests, agnostics, pagans, and other assorted scoffers show up on the religion thread?","Just curious.","I know that I have written several responses to this question. However, I now have too many answers to sort through and find the ones I'm thinking of. (New features needed!)\n\nSo, I'll start from scratch.\n\nFirst of all, I resent being lumped in with ""assorted scoffers."" I believe that I have been nothing but curteous to the people of faith here. I openly deny their belief-system. They openly deny mine. That's fine. We have, however, engaged in some very respectful debate, much to the benefit (I hope) of both sides. I know that my beliefs have not changed, but my preconceptions about young-Earth Christians have been shattered by some of the people I have found here. I think that they are wrong, but I am thrilled to have the opportunity to debate with them without resorting to name-calling or rudeness.\n\nGranted, this requires an openness on both our parts. I think that their faith is ""wrong."" They think that my lack of faith is ""wrong."" This is where most people get hung up and debate can go no further. If someone disagreeing with you is ""offensive,"" you're stuck. Once you accept this disagreement, you are quite free to exchange ideas. This is what I have found here (for the most part.)\n\nAs for why I spend so much time in the religion and spirituality forum, I see faith as playing a huge role in the lives of everyone in the world, be they moderate Muslims, fundamentalist Christians, Pagans, or Atheists like myself.\n\nIn my supposedly free country I see gays discriminated against due to faith. People who would never think of using the N-word openly hate and criticize homosexuals for what they are, not who they are. \n\nI see medical advances that could help millions of people stymied by arguments that have their basis in faith. Stem cell research could potentially ease the suffering of billions around the globe, but people of faith stand in the way.\n\nWe are currently involved in what may or may not be a holy war. This is an issue of faith.\n\nOur current government supports ""faith-based initiatives"" in what may be a breach of The Constitution itself.\n\nI know that faith helps people sleep at night. This doesn't undo the tremendous amount of suffering it has inflicted at every turn of history. \n\nI see faith as a problem, and would like to encourage people to put aside their myths and embrace reason. However, I realize that this is futile. As Jonathan Swift said, ""It is useless to attempt to reason a man out of a thing he was never reasoned into.""\n\nThat said, I think that Yahoo Answers provides a wonderful opportunity to try to see where other people are coming from. I disagree with the Christians (and Muslims and Pagans...), but I think it is very important for me to try to understand them. I would hope that they will try to understand me. Once we find some common ground and some mutual respect, we can truly start to talk about things.\n\nI hate the name-calling. The largest problem I have with religion is that it is divisive. I feel that this is the most important aspect of faith that needs to be removed from the equation. Name-calling is also divisive and does not fit into my attempts to act reasonably.\n\nI feel that I deny, but do not scoff. I embrace and enjoy open debate. I think that the things discussed here are important. I'd like to think that some of the things I have to say are pertinent. \n\nIf you want a place for only Christians (for example) to exchange ideas, there are plenty of places on the web for that. However, I think that this exclusion of other mindsets and worldviews does a disservice to those who would seek such a closed system.\n\nThat's why, as an atheist, I show up on the religion thread."

It is so much better than service pack 1 because it includes so many more security and performance fixes than sp1. It takes up so much space because it is a lot of fixes, has some new features, and it has an uninstaller. Yes, you can roll back to SP1, so it needs a lot of backup files. Don't ask me why, I don't get it.\nThe new features are Win XP yelling at you if you don't have Firewall or Antivirus software, or if it is off or outdated. Also, it has a lame firewall. Still better than nothing though."
"10","please tell me facts on the one child policy in china?","","With a population of 1.2 billion, one of the most serious social and economic problems still facing China is its huge population growth. Every year, China's population grows by 14 million people—three-quarters of Australia's entire population! \n\nUp until the 1970s the Chinese government regarded a growing population as a benefit in bringing about swift economic development. By 1963, the average number of children born to a Chinese woman was 7.5. \n\nIn recent decades, China's government has viewed population growth differently. With one-fifth of the world's population, but only 7 per cent of the world's arable land, continuing strong population growth would bring about great hardships, extreme poverty and famine. \n\nThe Chinese government decided in the 1970s to control population growth. This has proved a very complex task. The main strategy the government introduced in 1982 was a radical family planning program to encourage couples to restrict their family size to just one child. This has become known as the 'One Child Policy'. \n\n\n\nPolicy incentives \n\nsalary bonus (urban) \nbigger land allocation (rural) \nextended maternity leave \npaid medical and hospital expenses \npriority access to housing, employment and schooling for the child \n\nDisobeying the policy \n\nwithdrawal of family allowance and medical benefits \nfines (even against everyone in the village or town) \ndemotion or discharge from a government job \n\n\nExceptions to the rule \n\nmembership of a minority ethnic group (can be allowed two or even more children) \nhaving a first child with a disability that is likely to result in inability to work \npregnancy after adopting a child \nrisk of 'losing the family line' without a second child (the first child being a girl) \nrural families with 'real difficulties' (all children so far being girls)"

If your life is not going as planned or you have had a lot of disappointments, see a therapist and figure out what is bugging you and learn to work through it. It is hard work, but if you want to get over your depression, which is a SYMPTOM of something else, you need to tackle the source. \nI hope this helps. Best of luck to you.\nFor minor blueness; exercise and do things for yourself (NOT shopping) by taking walks, reading, anything you REALLY enjoy for yourself."

"6","What country invented the game of soccer?","","WELL OBVIOUSLY ITS ENGLAND, BUT HERE IS SOME INFOMATION ABOUT ITS ORGIN:\n\nThe Laws of the Game are based on efforts made in the mid-19th century to standardise the rules of the widely varying games of football played at the independent schools of England. The first set of rules resembling the modern game were produced at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1848, at a meeting attended by representatives from Eton, Harrow, Rugby, Winchester and Shrewsbury, but they were far from universally adopted. During the 1850s, many clubs were formed, thoughout the English-speaking world, independent of schools or universities, to play various forms of football. Some came up with their own distinct codes of rules, most notably the Sheffield Football Club (formed by former pupils from Harrow) in 1857, which led to formation of a Sheffield FA in 1867. In 1862, J.C. Thring of Uppingham School also devised an influential set of rules."

"3","What is the name for my eyes color?","My eyes are dark blue combined with green and grey.. what do they call this color? They look like the color of sea water.","Turquoise this is the color,,, but in eyes  it is different:\nBlue-Green eyes\n \nBlue-green eyes, here with a yellow ring around the pupil, may appear to change colorA variant of blue eyes, blue-green eyes are quite rare and usually consist of an iris with a predominantly blue color, usually darker blue, with green streaks or stippling caused by a yellow- or copper-colored overlay. Yellow-, amber-, or copper-colored rings are often present around the pupil.\n\nThe exact color is often perceived to vary according to its surroundings. Wearing lighter blue colors or getting tanned tends to emphasize the blue components. Wearing bright red, green, and shades of yellow or brown can emphasize green components, or even give the impression of grey\n   A hazel eye is not the case:Hazel is usually used to describe eyes that contain elements of both green eyes and brown eyes, sometimes transitioning from green at the edges to brown around the pupil. This should not be confused with irises that display a brown, yellow, or copper-colored ring around the pupil, as in the grey iris shown below.\n\nSo i think ur eyes color is BLUE GREEN"

"2","What are the disadvantages of gram negative and gram positive bacteria?","","The positives can be stained, the others can't. The staining possibility is an advantage for further research under a microscope. There is even more to it because Gram-positive bacteria belong to a separate phylum different from the Gram negatives.  The stain becomes possible by a high amount of peptidoglycan in the cell wall, which typically, but not always lacks the secondary membrane and lipopolysaccharide layer found in Gram-negative bacteria"

"2","what is the moon's purpose?","why is it here?","It doesn't really have a purpose in the since that a firefighter has a purpose, but there are consequences of its being there.\n\nThe moon formed when the proto-earth was hit by a Mars sized asteroid during the very early years of the solar system - about 4.5 to 5 billion years ago. The resulting collision knocked a bunch of stuff into orbit around the Earth. That stuff quickly accreted together and the moon was formed.\n\nBecause the Earth has a (relatively speaking) large satellite there are a couple of consequences. Tides are the obvious one. But more important is that the gravitational attraction between the Earth and the Moon provide a weak link, but enough of a link that the Moon stabilizes the Earth's rotation. Right now our axis of rotation is about 23.5 degress tilted with respect to our orbital plane. It has probably always been close to this. \n\nWithout a large Moon, the small gravitational tugs from the other planets can lead to an instability where the axis of rotation (relatively) suddenly shifts - maybe from 23 degress to 85 degrees. This sort of jump has probably happened on Mars.\n\nIt is quite possible - though this is speculative - that because the Earth has never had its axis shift a great deal that the climate has always been stable enough for animals and plants. \n\nIn other words, without the Moon, it is quite possible that only algae and other primitive creatures would exist on Earth."

Basically this is checking to see that the card number is valid, and the card itself is valid.\n\nSwiping the card sends the card information, and transaction information to the financial institution. The financial institution returns a numerical code. The code can either be approved, or a trouble code that denies the transaction. If the transaction is denied with a trouble code, the specific code maps to an English definition for the denial of credit. For example, ""credit limit exceeded"", ""card not activated"", or ""not a valid account"".\n\nThe first four-six digits of the account number refer to a specific financial institution, which is a destination for the machine. For example, 5424 is issued by Citibank."

"7","whats this da vinci code?","im wondering? what is it all about? fact or fiction? please tell me!","Its fiction but its very interesting you should give it a read, it does seem so real and i had to keep reminding myself that it wasn't - i think it offends some catholics but i'm a catholic and wasnt offended its very entertaining.\n\nThe Da Vinci Code is a novel written by American author Dan Brown and published in 2003 by Doubleday Fiction (ISBN 0385504209). It is a worldwide bestseller with 36 million copies in print (as of August 2005) and has been translated into 44 languages. Combining the detective, thriller and conspiracy theory genres, the book is part two of a trilogy that started with Brown's 2000 novel Angels and Demons, which introduced the character Robert Langdon. In November 2004, Random House published a ""Special Illustrated Edition"", with 160 illustrations interspersed with the text.\n\nThe plot of the novel involves a conspiracy by the Catholic Church to cover up the true story of Jesus. This implies that the Vatican consciously knows it is living a lie, but does so to keep itself in power. The novel has helped generate popular interest in speculation concerning the Holy Grail legend and the role of Mary Magdalene in the history of Christianity. Fans have lauded the book as creative, action-packed and thought-provoking. Critics have attacked it as inaccurate and poorly written, and decry the many negative implications about the Christian Church.\n\nThe book opens with the claim by Dan Brown that ""all descriptions of artwork, architecture, documents, and secret rituals in this novel are accurate""; but this claim is disputed by academic scholars in the fields the book discusses (see Criticisms of The Da Vinci Code and the further reading list below). As widely noted in the media, there has been substantial confusion among readers about whether the book is factual."

So we create the concept of God, whose only necessary property is being ""that which explains existence."" \n\nThis doesn't tell us much about god, though.

Another time, the house we made an offer on was on Solana and, when we had dinner at Chili's that night, they had ""Solano Steak"" on the menu.  We got the house.\n\nDo I really believe in ""signs"" from some divinity? No. I just believe that these events are constantly happening but we only register them when we are ready to receive them.

In it, you will state the quantity and detailed description of the contents, weight and total value. The recipient on the other hand may pay custom duties on the item/s received depending on the rules of their postal services. \n\nSellers on eBay as well as other sellers anywhere on the Internet -- whether you use the post office, private shippers or customs brokers -- are all required to fill out the custom form when shipping to buyers. Ecommerce companies like Amazon and eBay sellers do not shoulder the custom duties for the buyer, as the buyer will have to pay for that. I know of Adsense publishers in England who received some techie gift goodies from Google last Christmas who were charged with duties on the items received. A buyer from the Philippines who purchases books from US-based Amazon may pay custom duties on the items received.\n\nMost of the small items that ship out are not inspected by customs, though there are countries (especially during holiday season) where they are more strict and inspect and open the packages received.\n\nHope this helps\nIsabel Isidro\nFor information on starting a business, visit http://www.powerhomebiz.com"

"1","Should I become Catholic?","My husband of 7 months is Catholic. I was raised pennacostal but For many years have not felt a part of that church. My husband doesn't care if I never become catholic and niether does any of his family. I am very faithful and since I have been with him (4 years) I have been going to his church. I began the RCIA program at his church to convert but because of bad timing and a bad experience I haven't continued. What gets me is that the catholic church beleives that even though I was dedicated (what I always beleived to be baptised) isn't the same as being baptized. To join the caltholic church I'd have to become baptized at 24 years old and that sort of seems to me like I'm saying all the the religion I recieved as a young adult didn't really count and NOW I'm getting to the stuff that counts. Does that seem weird?","yea i know what you mean about being baptized...i'm also catholic =P...uhh well i don't know the customs of other christian branches but catholics have a set of symbolic ceremonies. well im guessing you know wat the ""original"" sin was...the whole adam and eve thing...the ceremony is just symbolic for washing away that sin and joining the catholic church...there's like ""first communion"" and finally your ""confirmation"" into the catholic faith...as i said alot of ceremonies. it's just the many ways to verify your faith throughout your life and accepting God. i think its understandable that you feel you're denouncing your previous faith but you shouldn't feel that way though. i don't know what you're going through because i was born into it but maybe if you become more involved in the church you'll feel a better connection with God. besides thats all that matters right? your connection with God? there's no shame in being baptised at 24 =). having the same religion as your husband will probobly be nice for when you have children you know...cuz then you would be going to church together. i know alot of people who don't share their spouse's religion and their children are a bit lost and usually don't believe in anything at all. well good luck!"

"4","who and what did lonnie g.johnson?","","For years, Lonnie G. Johnson has been inventing thermodynamics systems for NASA and other organizations; but he has won his greatest fame for re-inventing the squirt gun.\n\nJohnson capped a childhood of tinkering with appliances in his senior year of high school, when he won a national inventing competition for ""Linex,"" a remote-control robot he had built out of junkyard scraps. He went on to more formal training at Tuskegee University, where he earned first a B.S. in Mechanical Engineering (1972) and then an M.S. in Nuclear Engineering (1974). \n\nSoon thereafter, Johnson joined the U.S. Air Force, where he became an Advanced Space Systems Requirements Officer at the headquarters of the Strategic Air Command in Omaha, Nebraska. After directing many projects and earning several decorations, as well as a Nomination for Astronaut Training, Johnson moved on to NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in California. Here he helped develop thermodynamic and controls systems for space projects, including award-winning work for the Galileo Jupiter probe and the Mars Observer project; his crowning achievement at JPL was the Johnson Tube, a CFC-free refrigeration system with a hydraulic heat pump, which later earned Johnson his seventh patent (#4,724,683; 1988). \n\nWhile with the USAF and JPL, Johnson continued to invent at home. In 1985, he founded his own company, later renamed Johnson Research and Development.. Johnson had first conceived his most famous invention in 1982: when a homemade nozzle at his bathroom sink shot a spray of water across the room, Johnson resolved to invent the world's first high-performance, pressurized water gun. \n\nJohnson with partner Bruce D'Andrade finally created a workable prototype of the now famous SuperSoaker® in 1989. They filed for a joint patent (granted 1991) and found a manufacturer, Larami Corp. (now a subsidiary of Hasbro, Inc.). The SuperSoaker® uses an air pump to pressurize its water supply, allowing for tremendous distance and accuracy in water-marksmanship. Those unfamiliar with this product cannot appreciate its popularity: since 1990, over 40 million SuperSoakers® have generated over $200 million in sales; today, dozens of websites are devoted to them. \n\nMeanwhile, Johnson has earned over 40 patents, and continues to invent in the realms of thermo- and fluid dynamics as well as toys. In addition to ongoing controls work for NASA, Johnson and his company are developing an improved home radon detector, a rechargeable battery, and a heat pump that uses water instead of freon, among other projects. \n\nLonnie Johnson has won numerous honors for his success in inventing and entrepreneurship, and his constant encouragement of young people to invent. He is a legendary businessman and public figure in his hometown of Marietta, Georgia---whose Mayor declared February 25, 1994 ""Lonnie G. Johnson Day"" in his honor---and, thanks to the SuperSoaker®, he is a hero to kids nationwide."

"3","What can be done to stop hiccups?","","Hiccups are gulping sounds caused by involuntary spasms of the diaphragm. The diaphragm is the muscle that separates the chest and abdomen and helps with breathing. Hiccups can be triggered if you eat too much or too fast, consume very hot or cold foods and beverages, or drink carbonated beverages. Other causes include cold showers, entering or leaving a hot or cold room, sudden excitement, and stress. \nHiccups are not a serious medical condition and usually disappear on their own within a few minutes. If they last longer than 24 hours, hiccups may be a sign of another condition or injury. You should see your health care provider if you experience prolonged hiccuping. \n\nHome remedies are usually the primary treatment for hiccups, although no one is really sure how well they work. Hiccup home remedies include sneezing, being suddenly frightened, holding your breath, gargling, drinking pineapple juice, drinking water rapidly, sipping ice water, or swallowing dry granulated sugar. These activities may help by altering breathing patterns."

"5","what are the main differences between cat5 ant cat6 cabel?","","Ok... to say that it's twists per foot is, although technically accurate, a pretty lame answer.\nThere are three standards to speak of: CAT 5, CAT 5e, and CAT 6.\nTrue CAT 5 runs at 100 Mbit/s.\nCAT 5e is capable of 1000 Mbit/s (gigabit).\nCAT 6 is capable of 1000 Mbit/s (same as CAT 5e) but the difference is that due to the tighter twisting CAT 6 provides much less noise and therefor significantly reduces error correction - especially over longer distances.\nIn terms of a patch cable CAT 6 will realize a 10 X increase in speed over CAT 5 - but essentially no increase in speed versus a CAT 5e.\nIn terms of straight-through cabling CAT 6 will realize a 10 X increase in speed versus CAT 5 cabling. CAT 6 will also realize a slight increase in speed compared to CAT 5e over longer distances due to limited line noise. Over shorter distances in a straight-through situation the difference between CAT 5e and CAT 6 is negligible.\nThe trick to wiring CAT 6 is to never strip more than one inch of shielding when terminating the wire. Stripping (unpairing) more than an inch will decrease network quality."

The CD is for him (and you) it should be the stuff you like and not what people here think is popular.\n\nLast but not least... make sure you don't make the CD too sleepy... too many romantic songs that sound the same could do that to you!

Such an equation is equivalent to equating a first-degree polynomial to zero. These equations are called ""linear"" because they represent straight lines in Cartesian coordinates. A common form of a linear equation in two variables is \ny = mx + c \n(e.g. y = 3x + 5)\nIn this form, the value m will determine the slope or gradient of the line; and the value c will determine the point at which the line crosses the y-axis. Equations involving terms such as x2, y1/3, and xy are ""non-linear""."

"2","What are homologous chromosomes?","","'There are two general types of reproduction, asexual and sexual. Asexual reproduction involves only one parent, the offspring of which have chromosomes identical to those of the parent. Sexual reproduction generally involves two parents, each of which contributes half the chromosomes to the offspring. In the normal body cells of diploid organisms the chromosomes occur in pairs – one set being derived from the male parent and the other from the female parent. The two chromosomes of a pair are called homologous chromosomes. Thus each body cell in humans contains 46 chromosomes – 22 matched pairs from either parent, and one pair of sex chromosomes. In most animals, including humans, there are two kinds of sex chromosomes: X chromosomes, which are similar in size to the other chromosomes, and the smaller Y chromosomes. A combination of two X chromosomes gives a female, while one X and one Y chromosome gives a male'."

"7","How long do you think our economy will hold up with a sixty-plus billion trade deficit per month?","","Our economy will hold up just fine because, historically, (1) growing trade deficits signal improving economic conditions while (2) shrinking deficits often occur in times of economic trouble. \n\nDuring the last 30 years, the U.S. economy has on average grown about a percentage point faster, 3.5 percent vs. 2.6 percent, in years when the trade deficit expanded compared with years when it shrank. The unemployment rate on average fell 0.4 percentage points during years of rising deficits and rose 0.4 points when the deficit shrank. Manufacturing output rose much faster during years of rising trade deficits than during years of shrinking deficits.\n\nAmerica's largest trade deficits in recent decades occurred during economic expansions, its smallest deficits during recessions. It's no coincidence that as the economy shows signs of slowing down, the monthly trade deficit numbers have also begun to shrink with the economy's growth rate. \n\nAnother unfounded worry about the trade deficit is that it will saddle future generations with an unsustainable ""foreign debt."" It is true that foreign investors own about $1.5 trillion more in U.S.-based assets than Americans own in foreign assets abroad. But about half of foreign-owned assets in the United States are not debt but equity--direct investment in factories and real estate and portfolio investment in corporate stock. And the $1.5 trillion in net foreign investment in the United States is only about 16 percent of Gross Domestic Product, and 4 percent of the net wealth of all U.S. households and non-profit organizations. Net payments to finance our foreign ""debt"" were less than $20 billion in 1999, about one-fifth of one percent of GDP.\n\nAnother worry is that chronic trade deficits will spook foreign investors and undermine the foreign-exchange value of the U.S. dollar -- sending stock and bond markets and the real economy into a tailspin. The problem with that scenario is that it ignores the fact that trade deficits are linked to a strong, not a weak, dollar. The trade deficit increases the supply of dollars in the global economy, as foreign producers accept more dollars in payment for imports. But in times of economic expansion, the demand for those dollars by foreign investors seeking to buy U.S. assets is even greater. As long as foreign demand for U.S. assets remains strong, the dollar will remain high, and so will the trade deficit.\n\nThe best policy is to ignore the trade deficit, however large it may now seem, and concentrate on maintaining a strong and open domestic economy that welcomes foreign investment. As long as investors world-wide see the United States as a safe and profitable haven for their savings, the trade deficit will persist, and Americans will be better off because of it."

"10","will the problems in iraq ever be resolved? how do we get our soldiers home. can we win this war?","","The problems in Iraq will be solved when the oppressed people of Islam seek a reformation of their own religion, and they can't do that unless there is a champion to help protect them from abuses.  The U.S. is doing that.  Our troops will never come home unless we seriously change the nature of the U.S.  First, we have to become isolationist, and hope the rest of the world doesn't go into a dark age.  Second, we have to train out children to be cowardly and uncaring, so that protecting our own interests and the interests of freedom and democracy go unnoticed around the globe.  Third, we have to silence the people who speak out about the wrongs conducted at an astonishing rate in other countries, and simply listen more to the people who say it is all our fault.\n\nWe can never win this war.  It will never end.  The enemy will just change names, change religions, change ethnicities, change ideologies.  The enemy is ignorance encouraged by ""it's not my problem"" as an attitude.\n\nAnd we'll always be there to fight it.  You keep speaking up.  Free speech is part of it.  Don't let me silence you, or anyone else silence you.  Free speech may make a liar out of me yet and maybe the rest of the world will join us in letting freedom ring."

But everyone may tag the same thing very differently, the tags may only be meaningful to the person who come up with them and may have nothing to do with the meaning of the contents. I believe that searching based on tags by other people is mostly meaningless. Agree?","The idea is that you might put a tag on a document that totally doesn't contain the word you associate with the link.  For instance, a page about building Muppets might contain a pic of David Bowie because of that Labyrinth movie.  The page might not contain any reference to him, and the picture might not be named after him, but when I ""tag"" that page with his name, you'll be able to find that rare pic of him.\n\nI would guess that any one person's tags are pretty well meaningless, but when you aggregate them all together, meaning emerges."

To beat heat radiation, the sides of the inner bottle are coated in a reflective surface (it looks like aluminum/glass to me).

Also ognion + garlic.\n* Try eat mostly fresh vegs & fruits (whenever possible, of course)\n* If you really want a book, then check this out: The Negative Calorie Diet Workbook & Cookbook - eBook (Win95/98 only). Read more about this e-book here.\n\n\n• Eat fish, chicken, beef, pork. (preferences are in this order)\n\n* If you are a vegetarian, then ignore this!\n* Avoid fat meat\n\n\n• Eat 2-3 slices of bread/day. Don't EVER exclude bread from your diet!\n\n• Snacks between meals (if needed): apples, oranges, grepfruits and other NC fruits\n\n* Don't cheat ... NO cookies, chips, candies, brownies etc! \n* EVEN if they have ""low fat"" indication... They might have low fat, yet they can have lots of CALORIES !!!\n\n\n• About rice, potatoes, beans, [xxx]nuts, pastry, pasta... you know!\n\n* Don't eat too much of those, at least during the first weeks of the diet. I'm not a low carb addict, but I've noticed weight gains if consuming those in large quantities, especially when associated with other foods.\n* If you like them a lot, try and eat them like one meal. A nice delicious plate of spaghetti could be your lunch (never dinner!), followed by a nice big apple. These rich starch foods are not good for dinner!\n* At dinner time, chose mainly large mixed veggies salads... with fish, lean meat or cheese (if you are not a vegetarian). \n\nif u want to lose weight the best food to it are baked potatoes with nothing on it. no salt no nothing just plain. u can eat a 10000000000 baked potatoes till ur stuff and not gain a pound. i heard that from a weight loss tape. the best drink is water or gatorade. thats a start then when you work out do some taeboo. if u want a macine. run with dumbells on a treadmill. u could do the rocky workout. but thats a new story. u could use a butterfly macine i think it works the abs\n\n1) It is not just the amount you eat, but what you eat. Lean meats and vegtables that snap are a good place to start. And by snap I mean fresh and not boiled or doused with better or whatever.\n\n2) Exercise moderatly but for about an hour every other day. Spend half of that walking or running at a good enough pace for you to feel labored. The other half of the time use weights, or exercises such as push ups or situps to get a muscle ""burn"". A gym is also an option, but I don't know if you have the money for or want to spend the money on it.\n\n3) Sleep well. To bed earlier and up earlier. Exercise in the morning when you wake up, not in the evening before bed. 7 hours of GOOD sleep is a must.\n\n4) Occupy yourself with a hobby that keeps your attention for a long period of time. A hobby like this keeps your mind focused and gives less of a chance for snacking from boredom.\n\nThat is a good place to start... if you see good results, keep it up and modify to fit you... if it does not, see a doctor AND a trainer \n\nKeep working out, drink water a lot, eat 5 to 6 meals a day but in small quantities, vegtables are important specially cucumber and lattice, fruits not be eaten after meals except by 2 to 3 hours, minimize the starch quantities in your meals lots of salad is important, your last meal must be before you sleep by 2 to 3 hours\nthe most important thing is you don't lose patient wait and have a strong will to be as what you want\n\nyou might have some more ideas from www.ivillage.com\n\ngood luck"
"7","Why did kamikaze pilots wear helmets? They are just going to die anyways!?","","The truth is that Japan has a horrible infestation of leather helmets- football helmets, motorcycle helmets, airplane helmets.  The government realized that the only way to handle the growing epidemic was to encourage unsafe behavior(REALLY unsafe behavior) while at the same time wearing one of the dastardly items.  Thus, the Kamikaze pilot was born.  Unnoticed in the annals of history, though, are the equally deadly ""Crazy Motorcyclist"" and the "" Mad Footballer"" -phenomenon.  So, while Japan lost the ""War"" they in fact survived the real issue- they were able to decimate the leather helmet population, thus ensuring the safety of future generations to come."

So sand, gravel, the specific gravity is 9.8 meters/sec ( in a vaccuum, meaning where there is absolutely no air resistance but since places that this aren't normal you have to assume wind resistance.)"

"4","What are some false aspects about Marcus Brutus in real life compared to the play?","","Marcus Brutus: Roman senator and praetor who helps plan and carry out Caesar's assassination. Historically, Marcus Junius Brutus (84-42 B.C.) enjoyed a reputation in his day among Roman republicans as a noble and fair-minded statesman. However, his opponents–notably supporters of Caesar–regarded him as a traitor. First, Brutus sided with Pompey the Great against Caesar when the Roman Civil War started in 49 B.C. After Caesar defeated Pompey at Pharsalus, Greece, in 48 B.C., he pardoned Brutus and appointed him governor of Cisalpine Gaul in 46 B.C. and a praetor of Rome in 44 B.C. But Brutus turned against Caesar a second time, helping to lead the conspiracy that led to Caesar’s assassination in 44 B.C. Brutus believed the action was necessary to prevent Caesar from becoming dictator-for-life, meaning that all power would reside in Caesar and not in the delegates representing the people. In Shakespeare’s play, Brutus’s nobility and idealism gain the audience’s sympathy. But in the ancient Roman world of power politics, characterized by perfidy and pragmatism, it is his virtues that doom him. His downfall and death are the real tragedy of the play, not the death of Caesar.  \n\nWow, lot of info.  Definitely an interesting character--above quote from last link."

"2","What is sickle cell anemia?","","The links will give you more information. Here are two  brief overviews:\n\n   Sickle cell anemia is an inherited form of anemia — a condition in which there aren't enough healthy red blood cells to carry oxygen throughout your body.\n\nUnder normal circumstances, your red blood cells are flexible and round, and they move easily through your blood vessels to carry oxygen to all parts of your body. In people with sickle cell anemia, the red blood cells become rigid and sticky and are shaped like sickles or crescent moons. These irregular-shaped blood cells die prematurely, resulting in a chronic shortage of red blood cells. Plus, they can get stuck when traveling through small blood vessels, which can slow or block blood flow and oxygen to certain parts of the body. This produces pain and can lead to serious complications.\n\nThere's no cure for most people with sickle cell anemia. However, treatments can relieve pain and prevent further problems.\n\n-----------------------------------------------------\n\nSickle cell anemia is an inherited blood disorder characterized primarily by chronic anemia and periodic episodes of pain. The underlying problem involves hemoglobin, a component of red blood cells. Hemoglobin molecules in each red blood cell carry oxygen from the lungs to body organs and tissues and bring carbon dioxide back to the lungs. \n\nIn sickle cell anemia, the hemoglobin is defective. After hemoglobin molecules give up their oxygen, some may cluster together and form long, rod-like structures. These structures cause red blood cells to become stiff and assume a sickle shape. \n\nUnlike normal red cells, which are usually smooth and donut-shaped, sickled red cells cannot squeeze through small blood vessels. Instead, they stack up and cause blockages that deprive organs and tissues of oxygen-carrying blood. This process produces periodic episodes of pain and ultimately can damage tissues and vital organs and lead to other serious medical problems. Normal red blood cells live about 120 days in the bloodstream, but sickled red cells die after about 10 to 20 days. Because they cannot be replaced fast enough, the blood is chronically short of red blood cells, a condition called anemia."

Try not to be afraid.  You might be aware of the contacts at first (maybe for the first couple of days), but it shouldn't be painful.  Once your eyes adapt to them, you won't be able to feel them at all.  Someone at your doctor's office will be there to teach you how to put them in and take them out properly.  And you'll probably go back to see your doctor a week or two after you've had the contacts.  So if you have any problems or questions, you'll be able to talk about them then.  Just remember to follow your doctor's instructions and also remember that you can never lose a contact behind your eye (it's not physically possible).  Good luck and enjoy your new contacts!"

"4","Who was the first African -American to run for president and when?","","Shirley Chisholm\nShirley Anita St. Hill Chisholm (November 30, 1924 – January 1, 2005) was an American politician, educator and author. She was a Congresswoman, representing New York's 12th District for seven terms from 1969-1983. In 1968, she became the first African American woman eto make a serious bid to be President of the United States.\n\nShe was born in Brooklyn, New York as Shirley St. Hill. she spent part of her childhood in Barbados with her grandmother, attending the local British-run school system. She later attended Brooklyn College and graduated with a Bachelor of Arts degree in 1949. While working as a teacher, Chisholm earned a Master's degree in elementary education from Teachers College, Columbia University. From 1953-1959, she was director of the Hamilton-Madison Child Care Center, and from 1959-1964 was an educational consultant for the Division of Day Care.\n\nIn 1964, Chisholm ran and was elected to the New York State Legislature. She then ran as the Democratic candidate for New York's 12th District congressional seat and was elected to the House of Representatives in 1968. She defeated Republican candidate James Farmer, to become the first African American woman elected to Congress.\n\nAs a freshman, Chisholm was assigned to the House Forestry Committee. Given her district, she felt the placement was a waste of time and shocked many by demanding reassignment. She was placed on the Veterans' Affairs Committee. Soon after, she voted for Hale Boggs as Majority Leader over John Conyers, even though Boggs was white. As a reward for her support, Boggs assigned her to the much-prized Education and Labor Committee; she was the third-highest ranking member when she retired.\n\nChisholm joined the Congressional Black Caucus in 1969 as one of its founding members. In 1972, Chisholm made a bid for the Democratic Party's presidential nomination, and received 152 delegate votes, but ultimately lost the nomination to South Dakota Senator George McGovern. Chisholm's base of support was ethnically diverse and included the National Organization for Women. Among the volunteers who were inspired by her campaign was Barbara Lee, who would go on to become a congresswoman some 25 years later. Chisholm said she ran for the office ""in spite of hopeless odds,"" ""to demonstrate the sheer will and refusal to accept the status quo.""\n\nChisholm created controversy when she visited rival and ideological opposite George Wallace in the hospital soon after his shooting during that campaign. Several years later, when Chisholm worked on a bill to give domestic workers the right to a minimum wage, Wallace got her the votes of enough southern congressmen to push the legislation through the House. Throughout her tenure in Congress, Chisholm would work to improve opportunities for inner-city residents. She was a vocal opponent of the draft and supported spending increases for education, healthcare and other social services, and reductions in military spending. She announced her retirement from Congress in 1982, and was replaced by a fellow Democrat in 1983. After leaving Congress, Chisholm was named to the Purington Chair at Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts, where she taught for four years. She was also very popular on the lecture circuit.\n\nChisholm was married to Conrad Chisholm from 1949-1977. Upon their divorce, she married Arthur Hardwick, Jr., who died in 1986.\n\nShirley Chisholm was a member of Delta Sigma Theta Sorority. In 1993, she was inducted into the hwguhqvf uuiguiwegfvyu8gwevjkbasduibvadhusgv whyidbv789wdubvhj7dbvhjsdyuvsdvNational Women's Hall of Fame.

"3","is the b-12 shot effective for losing weight?","","No, I don't think so.  I give myself a B-12 shot once a month, but that is because my body can't absorb B-12 from the food I eat.  My doctor says that it really has nothing to do with helping you lose weight.  YOu only need a B-12 shot if your body doesn't absorb it, and this often happens to women as they age.  Vitamin B-12 deficiency is quite serious over time, so if you need it you should get it.  \n\nHowever, if you need it, you may feel better once you start getting enough B-12, which would then help you lose weight."

"2","what chemical is Pb(OH)2?","","Lead(II) hydroxide\n\nPb is lead, the roman numeral II (2) indicates the charge of the lead, and OH is hydroxide.  Incidentally, everyone so far has missed the II, which is what distingishes Pb(OH)2 from Pb(OH)4 or lead (IV) hydroxide.\n\nPlumbous hydroxide is the old school name (sorry, but plumbium hydroxide is just plain wrong).  Plumbous comes from the latin word plumbium, meaning lead, which is also where that atomic symbol for lead (Pl) comes from.  Interestingly, Pb(OH)4 is commonly refered to by its old name, plumbic acid.\n\nRizza, lead carbonate would be PbCO3."

"4","what's the difference between a novel and a short story?","","Uh... length? A novel is much longer. Besides that, there are some structural differences:\n\nA short story is more compact, and there is less room for character development. Author must choose to sacrifice plot points or development to keep his short story short. Often, short stories focus on only one, or at least very few central themes.\n\nA novel can be as long-winded as the author likes. Novels can incorporate a wide range of themes and ideas. There is unlimited room for character and plot development.\n\nThe difference lies in what the author must sacrifice in exchange for brevity."

But if you really like this person, you should do something sweet to tell her.  It always gets to them.  If you know what she likes, then try to make something with that.  Like say for example many girls like flowers.  A friend of mine that liked somone asked me how to tell this girl he liked that he liked her.  I told him since at the time that we were selling carnations, that he should buy her some and send her a poem.  It worked!  She said yes and everything is fine.

Well, whose to say?  Unconventional to society as a whole?  To a religious group?  In general, one can argue that all lifestyles can be classified as unconventional.\n\nSociety tends to hold the idea of an unconventional lifestyle as one that is separated from society.  Loving art, nature, etc. more that wealth, success, etc. is a good example.  For Bohemians, they rejected private property and materialism by having no permanent residence anywhere and by surviving on little material wealth. They also rejected strict moral values by living carefree lives of alcohol and drug use, as well as open sexual freedom. \nThey rejected the pursuit of wealth by living solely for art and literature's sake, pursuing their passions regardless of whether they gained an income, which they usually did not. \nTo most societies, this is an unconventional lifestyle."

For reasons of compatibility, operability, and cost, Microsoft became, for all intents and purposes, a monopoly because the consumers chose them by the product purchases they made.  Consumers were always free to buy an Apple computer, DR-DOS, WordPerfect, and any of countless other products.  However, they didn't because there was an economy of scale by being able to exchange Word and Excel documents, buy a computer from competing manufacturers which ran the same software, and purchase software written for Windows becuase it was too costly for the developers to write software for multiple platforms.  Thus it was ""natural"" rather than being given sole license by any particular governing body such as the US Government.\n\nhttp://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_monopoly"

"2","when we see one yarning..we also will yarn..why is that happeneing...?","","The reasons for this are unclear; however, recent research suggests that yawning might be a herd instinct. Other theories suggest that the yawn serves to synchronize mood behavior among gregarious animals, similar to the howling of the wolf pack during a full moon. It signals tiredness to other members of the group in order to synchronize sleeping patterns and periods of activity.

"3","what is true love is all about?","","for me.. true love is when you have to sacrifies a lot! give your him what he desires and would make him happy even if it means a lot to you for the opposite thing. like having a baby, most women don't like being pregnant for the very ovious reasons, first, the pain! nothing compares to the pain you will endure while being pregnant specially when giving birth. second, your life is at risk delivering your baby. like what they say, giving birth puts the half of you body 6 feet below the ground! and still you would take the plunge to take it for him!\n\nand also true love for me is all about taking care of his feelings! like when we are on a fight, i don't shout at him or even say bad words to him even if im about to burst with anger. i've learned to control/prevent this things because that i dont want him to be hurt with either my actions or words. and learning that was a hell lot of love! and him saying the first sorry for that fight and telling me that he would never want us to be in a fight again even if i was the one who started it all.. that's true love.\n\ntrue love is also not letting go, even thru your toughest situations, thru thick or thin, supporting one another through their deepest moments. \n\n..feeling both your most happiest moments when your together, even if your not doing anything or talking about something. just being with each other just makes you the happiest and luckiest person to be.\n\nbeing all worried and even praying for his safety when i have no idea where he might be.\n\nand even if im mad at him for having me wait at our meeting place, i just couldn't help but smile when i sight him even from afar, my heart just trembles with joy when i see him.\n\n..true love is all about swallowing your pride and true \nlove is nothing without honesty and being TRUE!! :)"

"4","what are the effects of deforestation?","im working on a science research paper and needed help...","well, its obvious that there will be ""less trees"", i mean come on, ""deforestation"". But, for a more logical response, which I am sure is the one you are looking for, is that deforestation will cause an imbalance in the ecosystem. With deforestation, populations of animals are decreased, making some of those populations to migrate, and others to die as a result of their migration/deforestation. As a result, a kind of ""butterfly effect"" will occur, because now, these animals would have changed their behavior in order to adapt to their new environment. And even though some say that this would help the future of the ""human race"", it actually decreases its chances of survival. And why might you ask? well, its simple. Due to the ozone layer ""tear"" in the atmosphere caused by the 1970's and 80's and still today, increasing population and removing trees which supply oxygen will make the situation worse. Hint, we will be poluting our world and then all these years of hard work to stop the tear in the ozone layer will be pointless. Furthermore, a ""further"" tear in the ozone layer will allow the extremely powerful UV rays from the sun to enter, which not only would cause another adaptation by animals initially caused by deforestation, but it would completely destroy vegetation, and even ""us"", etc. therefore my main point is, dont ""de-forest"" ."

"1","What is, in your opinion, the difference between faith and spirituality?","I see faith as being a belief that does not rest on logical proof or material evidence and spirituality as, well, I think Sam Harris sums it up pretty well: ""'Spirituality' or ""mysticism"" (both words are pretty terrible, but there are no good alternatives in English) refers to any process of introspection by which a person can come to realize that the feeling he calls ""I"" is a cognitive illusion. The core truth of mysticism is this: It is possible to experience the world without feeling like a separate ""self"" in the usual sense. Such a change in the character of one's experience need not become the basis for making unsupportable claims about the nature of the universe, however.""","Faith, as it is found in Christianity, is a cop out to really trying to understand the nature of the universe.  In Buddhism, the monks tell you not to take anything without evidence.  Why?  Because they are seeking the truth.  And, you do not find the truth by following things without evidence.  Spirituality, is developed when you discover a little more about the nature of our relationship to the infinite."

People will accept this part of you, and if they happen to reject you, just continue to believe in this peivce of yourself until you find a group that deems this quality socially acceptable.\nOf course, I am sure that you have more than just one truly great quality about yourself, and stive to learn all of them.

Since your case has been for a number of years, it is likely that aggressive therapy is necessary.  To date, treatment is mostly confined to speech therapy which helps to improve reading, writing, and comprehension skills.  Speech pathologists and neurologists would be best trained to help you recover. You should certainly contact a neurologist for more treatment information.  According to the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke, patients tend to recover skills in language comprehension more completely than those skills involving expression.\n\nOn a more global level, there are a number of people who believe neural connections can be re-forged through increased usage.  A number of studies have shown that those who think more or are involved in more intelletually challenging tasks are less at risk for Alzheimer's disease, for example.  This may very well be true for stroke patients.  Keep working hard and seek as much help as you can.  Best of luck."

"10","Wha is the importance o the monroe doctrine?","","Monroe Doctrine, principle of American foreign policy enunciated in President James Monroe's message to Congress, Dec. 2, 1823. It initially called for an end to European intervention in the Americas, but it was later extended to justify U.S. imperialism in the Western Hemisphere.Origins and Pronouncement \nThe doctrine grew out of two diplomatic problems. The first was the minor clash with Russia concerning the northwest coast of North America. In this quarrel, Secretary of State John Quincy Adams expressed the principle that the American continents were no longer to be considered as a field for colonization by European powers. That principle was incorporated verbatim in the presidential message. The other and more important part of the doctrine grew out of the fear that the group of reactionary European governments commonly called the Holy Alliance would seek to reduce again to colonial status the Latin American states that had recently gained independence from Spain.\nGreat Britain, which wished to maintain open commerce with the newly formed states, supported Latin American independence. The United States had just recognized the independence of these states, and in Aug., 1823, the British foreign minister, George Canning, proposed to the United States that a joint note be sent by the two governments protesting intervention in the New World by the Holy Alliance. President Monroe consulted with two of his predecessors, Thomas Jefferson and James Madison, who recommended that Canning's proposal be accepted. Secretary of State Adams dissented. He feared, with some justification, that the British would try to exact a pledge from the United States not to attempt to acquire any territory in Spanish America.\nMeanwhile, Canning had secured an agreement with France (which had earlier made the proposal that the Holy Alliance intervene in Latin America), by which France renounced any intention of intervention, thus obviating the need for a joint U.S.-British protest. However, Adams had by then proposed a unilateral action to President Monroe, who finally agreed to this course. The presidential message, therefore, announced that the United States would not interfere in European affairs but would view with displeasure any attempt by the European powers to subject the nations of the New World to their political systems. Thus in a sense the Monroe Doctrine as a dual principle of foreign policy (no colonization and no intervention by European states in the Americas) complemented the policy expressed by George Washington of noninterference in European affairs.\nApplication and Extension \nThe doctrine was not ratified by any congressional legislation; it did not obtain a place in international law, and the term Monroe Doctrine did not come into general circulation until the 1850s. Yet the doctrine became important in American policy, particularly when President Polk reasserted its ideas in 1845 and 1848 with respect to British claims in Oregon, British and French intrigues to prevent the U.S. annexation of Texas, and the aspirations of European nations in Yucatán.\nThe strained relations with Great Britain concerning its sovereignty over several areas in Central America in the 1850s renewed U.S. interest in the doctrine; Great Britain specifically denied its validity. During the Civil War, the doctrine was invoked unsuccessfully after Spain's reacquisition of the Dominican Republic (formerly Santo Domingo). It was also used, somewhat more effectively, to bring pressure on the French government to withdraw support from Maximilian, who had established an empire in Mexico under French auspices.\nUnder President Grant and his successors the doctrine was expanded. The principle that no territory in the Western Hemisphere could be transferred from one European power to another became part of the Monroe Doctrine. As U.S. imperialistic tendencies grew, the Monroe Doctrine came to be associated not only with the exclusion of European ("

Sadly, they're not giving the parolee the benefit of a doubt, either.\n\nNot the answer you're looking for, but it is the perspective of the law."

"7","how do you stop families from yelling instead of talking or complaining?","A member of the family always is in defensive of one of her children but not the other. You can't say a word without her yelling in defensive of her even when it is not necessary.","Most people who do this, don't have a clue about how they look like when they do it. I hope you could place a camera so that you can viedo tape her and then show the film to her. She will be the best judge of her own attitude.\nAnother tactic to stop families from yelling to each other is to place a ""suggestions box"", where the members of the family can write their complaints annonimously and then everybody can work things out together.\nOr play ""The Socratic Questioning Game""...this game is very interesting...instead of accusing or yelling...you have to say everyting in the form of a polite question: Instead of saying ""Don't yell at me!"" you say ""Why are you yelling at me?"" ..""Because you don't listen!""...then you ask ""Why do you think I'm not listening?""\nRules for this game:\n1.-Accept the answer eventhough you don't like it. An answer is an answer.\n2.-The question has to be made politely..it is a question, not an interrogation.\n3.-The process to change a bad habit takes time...yelling and fuzzing is a bad habit...be patient and constant until the cycle breaks and the bad habit disappears."

And don't lead a sedentary lifestyle - get regular exercise if you can, or if not that, at least incorporate more physical activity into your everyday routine."
"2","How do you survey?","","Surveying is the mapping of the land surface in three dimensions.  Usually a grid is set up in the area of interest.  A person with a surveying scope measures the distance to a target which the 2nd person in the surveying team is holding at a specific point on the grid.  They determine the distance between the points and the angle of elevation which can be used later to calculate the 3 D position of the point.  The very first point on the survey is the reference point, and all other measurements refer back to that one point.  They continue to take measurements at the intersection of the lines of the grid, and end up plotting these points with computer programs.  \n\nRoad surveying, however, may not focus on grid points, but be specific points on the road itself.  They may need to determine where the on ramp precisely intersects the higway, or where bridge pilings are, etc.  These intense feature-driven surveys are usually needed to scope out areas for new construction or modifications to existing construction.\n\nTopographical maps are 2 dimensional plots of points with different heights.  If you connect a dot between all the points with the same heights, you can visualize mountains and depressions on a 2D paper, and find out where flood zones are and which way water will flow.  \n\nCheck out the USGS for explanations of maps and cartography, etc.  The basics are a linear measuring tape, a surveying scope to determine angles of elevation, and a second person to hold the target.  Hope this helps!!"
"4","what foods do egypt eat?","its for a homework","Because Egypt was very dry, and relied mostly on the Nile River to water the crops, the Egyptians could only grow certain kinds of food. Mainly they grew wheat and barley. \n\nThe Egyptians made the wheat into bread and into soup and porridge, and they also added hops to make the barley into beer. In fact, some people think the real reason that the Egyptians first began growing grain was to make beer. This is an Egyptian model of beer jars (from the Louvre), which the Egyptians made to put in your grave when you died so you would have beer in the next world.\n\n(from the Louvre, Paris, France)\nThe Egyptians also ate meat. You could go to a butcher shop and buy meat there, just as people do today. Only because it rarely rains in Egypt, they could have the meat outside in the courtyard of the store instead of inside. Here is a model of a butcher shop, also from somebody's grave. Can you see the different cuts of meat all laid out? At the very bottom there is a whole leg of mutton.\nBut the Egyptians would not eat pigs (bacon or ham or pork or salami) because they thought pigs carried leprosy. They ate beef and mutton and duck and goose. \nFor dessert, the Egyptians liked to eat dates. This is a picture of some real Egyptian dates which were put into somebody's grave for them to eat in the next world, and which were preserved in the dry climate for three thousand years until archaeologists dug them up again.\nArchaeologists have also found seeds which show that the Egyptians grew watermelons, and other kinds of melon."

"2","Which plant can hold water in its stem?","How does it help the plant?","Another question asked by a teacher who doesn't know the subject she is trying to teach. \n\nAll plants can hold water in their stem. Even rainforest plants commonly store water in their stems.\n\nSome of the most spectacular water holding plants are the tea trees of Tropical Australia.  These trees mostly grow seasonal wetlands in areas that are literally flooded for part of the year and receive little rain  for the rest of the year. The trees are capable of holding several hundred litres of water  in bulging hollows in their trunks. What makes this so spectacular is that water exists as free water. It simply sits in a hollow in the wood, and if the wood is cut the water gushes out.  Aboriginal people obtained water during the dry months by cutting holes in the stems to drain the water.\n\nCacti, boabs and a range of other plants can also store large amounts of water in their stems, but none store it as large masses of free water as the tea trees do. Instead the water is held in the cells or the  vessel elements\n\n\n>>>>How does it help the plant?\n\nIt allows the plant to survive through periods when water is scarce. Most plants only store enough water to last for a few days while desert plants or plants from seasonally dry environments like the tea trees can store sufficient water to see them through weeks or months."

Remember there is a risk for any medication. Consult your doctor to see if you are in a higher risk group. You can go to planned parenthood if you cant afford to pay. They do a lot of service for free. And a lot of people think that all planned parenthood does is abortions but that is not true. So do consult a physician. to decide what is best for you. And also weigh your options. There are a lot of different types of birth control and some may have lower risks than others. also look on the web for more info. Yahoo health, webMD, and planned parenthood are great websites."

"10","what is debt servicing?","","Hereisyourwayoutofpaydayloans\nPayday debt[how to get out]\nWe first got into the loan because we needed car repairs and didn’t have enough money then someone told us we could get a payday loan.  We went to the payday store and it was so easy just needed to provide a bank statement, pay stub and post dated check for two weeks, my next payday, $575.00 they handed over $500.00 cash.  We really thought we would be able to pay it back and that would be that.  Then when payday came along $575.00 out of it would be hard as we were already living payday to payday.  We went back to the payday store and were told we could just pay the $575.00 cash then re-borrow again that sounded good we just didn’t think of the very high interest rate.  So if you borrow every two weeks at $75.00 interest for 26 weeks that equals $1,950.00 in a year.  So when we would re-borrow that would not  cover all of the bills because we would be short the $150.00 from the interest so we went to the next payday store to cover the monthly bills then we found we needed more money for some other need.  Then when we needed to pay off that loan we were short so we had to go to another to cover that loan then another and another before we knew it we were into four paydays per month.  Here is the calculation $75.00 x 4 loans =$300.00 per two weeks x 26 weeks per year $7,800.00 x 3 years $23.400.00. Paydays are suppose to be a happy time but when you are into them like we were it is a nightmare and very stressful, robbing Peter to pay Paul, running from one store to another. What was amazing is as I was going from one to another I would see the same people at each store, sad but true. \nOur website is    Hereisyourwayoutofpaydayloans"

"2","What is crossing over (during meiosis)?  I need it in a kids definition so she can understand.?","","Well, simply put, crossing over is what happens when the pair of homologous chromosomes contact each other, their DNA strands (=arms) become attached and some bits of genetic information are exchanged. Then the homologous chromosomes separate; notice that each is slightly different than it was before, because of the new information.\nThis process does not occur in ordinary body cells (otherwise our genetic composition would be variable), but only during the production of gametes (=reproductive cells). After separating, those two ""changed"" chromosomes that formed a pair in the parental cell will each go to a different gamete.  Thus, instead of having the exact same composition as the parent's cells, some of the gametes will be different. When a gamete combines with another to form a new being, there can always be novel combinations.\nPrecisely one of the advantages of sexual reproduction is the production of variability.\n\nHomologous = matched because each comes from one of the parents (one was in the egg and the other in the spermatozoid) and they have information for the same traits\n\nChromosome =  discrete packages of DNA; they're not visible during most of the cell's life, they only become denser at cell reproduction.\n\nI think the best way to explain this process would be to build a model using kiddie dough with different colors. It doesn't have to be complex, see the illustration at the link."

SoI will give you my best info.  \n\nYou've got your shrooms, but they are very dangerous, can cauuse liveror kidney failure.  Also there are good/bad trips.    That is going to go under Hallucinting powers. Could go to jail or prison, depending on how much you have if you sold it or whatever. The worng shrooms can make you brain dead.\n\n\n\nThen you have Acid.  Aka LSD. It is a schedule 1 drug, so prepare for jail time maybe prison if you get caught.  It makes you see stuff that is not there. You need someone with you when you take it because you will be confused and maybe paranoid.  LSD is known to trigger latent psychological and mental problems.\n   Then there are opiates.  THose are fun.  FOr a while.  Bet you get hooked fast and cannot afford to continue buying and no one will give you an rx and then you have to go to treatment.\n\nMeth  Your teeth fall our, hair falls out, this all happens right away and you lose everything.\n\nCrack cocaine:  Highly addictive, gets you into lots of trouble, some people (many) cannever stop after the first smoke.  \n\nPot:  Far asI know, just makes you stupid.

The site is cross between a library and a journal, both archiving older historical documents and information as well as publishing new articles.\n\nWhy was Erowid started? #\nAlthough the risks and problems of psychoactives are widely discussed, it's also clear that psychoactive plants and chemicals have played a positive role in many people's lives. Unfortunately, there is a serious lack of balance in the information provided by many resources. As our culture struggles with integrating the increasing variety and availability of these substances into its political and social structures, new educational models are clearly needed. Erowid is founded on the belief that a healthy relationship with psychoactives is one grounded in balance, where use is part of an active, intellectual, physical, and spiritual life. We believe that access to information is key to creating these healthier relationships with psychoactives.\n\n\nhttp://www.erowid.org\nhttp://www.erowid.org/ask/ask.cgi?A=ListByCat&Cat0=77&x=16&y=9\nGood luck on your search"

"2","why the stem cells exihibit the totipotency character and why not the other cells?","why the stem cells exhibit totipotency character and why not the other somatic and sexual cells?","As cells differentiate, certain genes are silenced.  This silencing is done by modifying the histones (a sort of protein spool about which DNA is wrapped) and making the DNA rather bunched up, and inaccessible to the transcrition factors and promoters that activate a gene.  The totipotent cell requires that none of its genes are thus silenced, while cells with a silenced gene will see the same silencing in its daughter cells."

As its the g/ml I guess you're looking at wet weight. The average weight of a bacteria is 9.5E-13 g [1]. Then you have to consider the size of the colony, it is normally assumed (for simplicity) that the bacteria have been diluted, so that they could be counted, to the extent that 1 bacteria = 1 cfu. Essentially this means that cfu*9.5E-13 = g/ml\n\nHope this helps"

It can be difficult to stop taking them without experiencing physical or psychological withdrawl. There are some things you can do to lessen the effects however.\n\n1.) You might want to consider speaking with your physician if you feel you have a problem, There are several medications that can lessen withdrawl symptoms. But you want to avoid the doctor, so maybe you could try these ideas.\n\n2.) You can try to wean yourself off of the pills slowly, reducing your dosage gradually or increase the time period between doses. This will be a process that takes place over time. You will still have to take the pills, and it could be a while before you get off of them, but you won't crack up from withdrawl!\n\n3.) You may want to consider meditation or other pain management techniques to reduce your dependence on painkillers and increase your willpower. \n\n4.) You could try another medication, something to help with calmness or nervousness. There are several herbal remedies you could try. Check out your local GNC for some hep if you want to avoid the doctor."

Always aware, always my head saying things, it never shuts up, even when I sleep, I get lucid dreams at least 4 times a week, during that time im aware of been sleeping, my brain wont shut down and I wake up happy for been flying in my dreams but mad about controling them with my awareness, and I just need a rest of my brain but dont know how.

Like can a male look at a female with bad intentions or lust and vice versa?\n\nI know pre marital sex is forbidden.\nThank you.","Jesus answered this by saying that if a man looks at a woman with lustful intent, he has already committed adultery with her in his heart. So it is a sin for man to engage in any activity which stirs up sexual thoughts about any woman to whom he is not married.\nSex is not at all dirty or evil - God invented the idea! and it is holy, pure and an incredible gift from God - to those who are married!\nGod put that limit on sexual relations for our own good - He is NOT just out to deprive single people!

"2","jus one simple answer that connect on wat is the chemical and physical property of iodine??","","< i·o·dine (ī'ə-dīn', -dĭn, -dēn') \nn.\n(Symbol I)2 A lustrous, grayish-black, corrosive, poisonous halogen element having radioactive isotopes, especially I 131, used as a medical tracer and in thyroid disease diagnosis and therapy. Iodine compounds are used as germicides, antiseptics, and dyes. Atomic number 53; atomic weight 126.9045; melting point 113.5°C; boiling point 184.35°C; specific gravity (solid, at 20°C) 4.93; valence 1, 3, 5, 7. \nA liquid containing iodine dissolved in ethyl alcohol, used as an antiseptic for wounds.\n[French iode, iodine (from Greek ioeidēs, violet-colored : ion, violet + -oeidēs, -oid) + –INE2.]\n\n\niodine (ī'ədīn, –dĭn) [Gr.,=violet], nonmetallic chemical element; symbol I; at. no. 53; at. wt. 126.9045; m.p. 113.5°C; b.p. 184.35°C; sp. gr. 4.93 at 20°C; valence −1, +1, +3, +5, or +7. Iodine is a dark-gray to purple-black, lustrous, solid element with a rhombic crystalline structure. It is the least active of the halogens, which are found in group VIIa of the periodic table. It is normally diatomic, i.e., it has 2 iodine atoms in each molecule, in the solid, liquid, and vapor states. When heated it passes directly from the solid to the vapor state (sublimation), the vapor having an intense violet color and a characteristic irritating odor. Iodine is only slightly soluble in water but dissolves readily in a solution of sodium or potassium iodide. Tincture of iodine is a solution of iodine and potassium iodide in alcohol. Iodine also dissolves in carbon disulfide, carbon tetrachloride, and chloroform, giving a deep violet solution. Iodine forms many compounds. With hydrogen it forms hydrogen iodide, which in water solution becomes hydriodic acid. It forms compounds with certain nonmetals (e.g., carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen) and with most metals. Iodine is displaced from its compounds by the other halogens. The element is obtained from salt deposits, as from the saltpeter beds in Chile, where it occurs in small quantities as an iodate, and from the salt brines associated with some oil wells in California and Louisiana. It is also found as an iodide in the ash of certain seaweeds. Iodine may be prepared by displacement from its compounds with chlorine. Treating an iodide with manganese dioxide and sulfuric acid sublimes the iodine. Iodine is important in medical treatment; tincture of iodine and iodoform are widely used. Iodine is employed in the preparation of certain drugs and in the manufacture of some dyes. Silver iodide, a yellow salt, is used in photography; it is water insoluble and turns black when exposed to light. Starch turns deep blue (almost black) in the presence of a small amount of iodine; this reaction serves as a test for either starch or iodine. Iodine in small amounts is essential to human nutrition; in the thyroid gland it becomes a part of the iodine-containing hormones. Goiter, a swelling of the thyroid, is often a symptom of inadequate iodine in the diet. Iodine has only one stable isotope, iodine–127; it is the only isotope of iodine occurring in nature, although 24 iodine isotopes are known. Iodine–131 is a radioactive isotope with a half-life of 8 days. It is used medically to diagnose abnormalities of the thyroid gland. It is also a component of fallout produced by nuclear explosions. Iodine was discovered in 1811 by Bernard Courtois."
"6","I have a baseball signed by 12 members of S.F.Giants including Willie Mays-Bobby Bonds?","Mike McCormick Gaylord Perry and others anybody know what year they won the world series and what value this ball might have?","A ball signed by Willie Mays alone will run around $250-$300 depending on the quality.  A ball signed by Bobby Bonds alone will run around $200, again varying by quality.\n\nA ball signed by both, and then more will be worth much more.  Especially if it has any established providence (You can authenticate the signatures and any good, real stories behind it).\n\nAs for being a WS ball, it is not one.  The four players you named only played together for 2.5 seasons, 1968 (Bond's rookie season) - July 1970 (when McCormick was traded).  Depending on other players on the ball, you may be able to narrow it down to the exact season.  They did not make the pennant in any of those seasons.  If you want to cross-check some other names, go to http://www.baseball-reference.com and go to the SFG page and look at those years for the rosters.\n\nHowever, the ball still has some classic HOF worthy signatures, and if authentic, could be worth some.  Value for an item like that is only what someone is willing to pay for it at the moment you want to sell it, and a reliable collectables shop should be able to get you a relatively good value, and help you get it sold if you want that."

"3","Any ideas on what to do for terrible hip pain?","I'm a 40 year male.  Twenty plus years ago I dislocted my hip.  I run and exercise and keep my weight down, but in the last few years my hip has gotten to the point where it's in various degrees of pain almost all the time.  I'd consider having my hip replaced except I know they last maybe 15 years, and probably a lot less for someone active.  I've also read that to replace a replaced hip is very tough and not too succesful.  I have to exercise; I know it's good for me overall, but am I making a mistake just trying to live with the pain.  I run but, oddly, walking causes me a lot more pain (immediate anyway) than jogging.  Has anyone else had to deal with this at a ""young"" age?   Am I being wise trying to stall the replacement, and hopes of a better procedure coming along, as long as possible???","Before you do surgery, try a chiropractor or massage therapist.  The chiropractor may find that your spine is out of alignment, which is putting strain on the hip.  Or a massage therapist may discover that the muscles are in spasm, or have trigger points, which they can help you with.  I have a bad hip from when I was pregnant, and both have helped me.  Also, both a chiropractor and a massge therapist can give you stretches to help prevent it from happening again, or at least not as much.\n\nBlessed be\n\ngypsy"

"2","when is friction produced?","","Friction occurs anytime there is resistance when two objects touch.  \n\nThe rougher the texture of an object, the more friction it can produce.  All the little tiny rough spots catch on each other (imagine running your hand over, say, a piece of sandpaper...you can feel the grains of sand catching at your hand; it's a lot different than running your hand over something smooth, like polished metal)  The rough surfaces catch at each other and stick together.  That's friction.\n\nFriction is the reason we can walk on the ground - otherwise, we'd slip and slide everywhere, as if we were on ice.  (Really, really slippery ice :p)\nFor another example, when you're driving down the road, friction between your tires and the road is what keeps your wheels rolling along.  \nIf you hit a patch of ice, and your wheels slip, it's because there's not enough friction to overcome the force of your wheels turning.  Ice is slippery - there's less friction between tires and ice than tires and the paved road."

It was a very unusual story about a man who fell in love with a nurse (I think). The nurse died young from something and the husband (a doctor I think) became obsessed with her. He got permission from the parents to bury her above ground and treat her body with chemicals to perserve her better. He would spend hours, nights and then days in the above ground tomb (a small room on a graveyard) that housed her body. He then stole the body and lived with the corpse (sleeping with her, and even having sexual contact with her) before he was discovered. \n\nI can't find the name of the film or any information about the events or people that would lead me to find the film or more info about this bizarre story.

"2","what is the cellular and molecular basis of muscle contraction,including the roles of actin, myosin, Ca+2, ATP","","1. At the neuromuscular juncture, ACh released by the synaptic terminal binds to receptors on the sarcolemma.\n\n2. The resulting change in the transmembrane potential of the muscle fiber leads to the production of action petential that spreads across the entire surface of the muscle fiber and along the T tubules.\n\n3.The sarcoplasmic reticulum releases stored calcium ions, increasing the calcium concentration of the sarcoplasm in and around the sarcomeres.\n\n4. Calcium ions bind to triponin, producing a change in the orientation of the troponin-tropomyosin complex that exposes active sites on the thin filaments (actin).  Cross-bridges form when myosin heads bind to the active sites on F actin.\n\n5. The contraction begins as repeated cycles of cross-bridge binding, pivoting, and detatchment occur, powered by the hydrolysis of ATP.  These events produce filament sliding, and the muscle fiber shortens."

If he is way into the outdoors, for example,  a book about all the best campsites around might be good.   If he is way into cars, then perhaps a subscription to a magazine about cars.  The key is haveing some knowlegde about what that person likes, and finding a gift that shows you know them, is better than something really expensive.\n\n\nOff hand, I would say that 30-35 year olds are pretty set in most of the things they are interested in.

MUCOS Pharma, the pioneer in systemic enzyme therapy, has been the standard bearer for the last fifty years in having paved the way to elucidate the function of enzymes, and their use as an oral systemic therapy.\n\nFunctions of Enzymes\n\nSince they have unique structure, each enzyme is meant to carry out a specific task. Any given enzyme is evolved to fulfill a definite function, and this specificity allows the body to strictly control the use of enzymes. Once activated, an enzyme will perform its specific function until it is ""exhausted,"" or it is inhibited by another enzyme, in which case its activity is curtailed and/or stopped. As researchers have found out after years of painstaking and laborious work, there is a good reason for this control: It prevents bodily processes from spinning out of control, which may be deleterious to health and wellbeing.\n\nEven casually, the specificity of enzymes suggests that there will be particular types. In fact, Nature has ""engineered"" families of enzymes for specific tasks. One of the most beneficial and abundant classes of enzymes is referred to as proteolytic enzymes. Enzymes in this category have the ability to ""nibble"" at other proteins, and break them down into smaller chains of amino acids. Hence the name, proteolytic enzymes, which literally means ""chewing up proteins.""\n\nOn the surface, it might appear counterintuitive to degrade proteins in the body. Are proteins not required for optimal cellular function, and do they not afford good health and vibrancy well into the golden years? Indeed, they do! In disease, however, the human body produces proteins that could potentially have injurious effects, and further compromise health if left unattended. It was precisely this goal that Drs. Max Wolf and Helen Benitez set themselves roughly one-half a century ago when they started their quest to find a wholesome, effective and safe alternative for human health and wellbeing. Of course, their objective was to understand how c comes about and whether natural alternatives could be designed that will not wreak havoc on the human body as radiation and chemotherapy do. Despite their scientific astuteness, little did Drs. Wolf and Benitez anticipate that their systemic enzymes will afford man immense health benefits, irrespective of whether or not systemic enzymes ""cured"" c.\n\nDrs. Wolf and Benitez, along with Dr. Karl Ransberger, a young biomedical researcher from Germany, tested a large number of enzymes from animal and plant sources. The work was slow, and it progressed in fits and starts, since the researchers had to optimize the conditions to isolate and purify the enzymes. Not only that, they had to struggle to maintain the activity of the enzymes, because the enzymes are notorious for being finicky and unstable. That is, if the enzymes are not handled properly under precisely defined condition, they become inactive. After all, the researchers were working in the 1950s, a time when the basic enzyme technology was still in its infancy, and individual scientists had to rely more on their wits than technology to tweak answers from Nature.\n\nOnce Drs. Wolf and Benitez had optimized the conditions necessary to maintain the enzyme activity, they started the next part of their work to combine and evaluate various enzyme formulations in assessing th"

I was injured while serving in the army and have had 2 knee surgeries and am looking at more. Since the injury and surgeries I have had a limp and now have to use a cain to help me get around. The VA tells me that the limp and the odd gait I've had for almost 21 years wasn't a factor. Any info on this would be appreciated","Go get an independent consult with an orthopedic  or sports med doctor.   These docs are youth oriented, and they want you to be able to be as active as you want to be. I'm only a RN, but I beg to differ with the VA. Favoring one side while walking with a cane over a protracted period of time, would put a strain on L4-5."
"7","what would you rather be a teddy bear or a snoopy doll?","","a teddy bear, they are adorable and people cuddle them, however if you are a snoopy doll, you might be a collectable and just sit there on the shelf, waiting for your day, watching the furry lovable, teddy bear get cuddled while you collect dust, sure maybe an ooohh or ahhh every once in a great while from a fan, but where is the deal love. The hug tight at night, the being drooled on and rolled over on when they fall asleep... Then as a Snoopy you sit, angry, bitter, but unable not to smile, until one day your rage and jealousy of the teddy bear take hold, and then... i don't want to be that teddy bear. So my answer is, i would prefer to be a teddy bear, unless there was a snoopy collectable in the house."
"1","Who is the Dajjal?","","dajjal is an evil figure in Islamic eschatology, who will appear before Yaum al-Qiyamah (Day of the Resurrection). He is highly similar to the Antichrist in Christianity.\nVarious hadith, or traditions, are preserved about the attributes of ad-Dajjal like the following:\n\n1.He will be physically misshapen, and have one eye. There will be skin covering the area where the other eye is supposed to be .\n2.He will deceive the faithful, teaching them that Heaven is Hell and vice versa. \n3.He will have the power to work miracles in order to mislead believers. \n4.He will try to put Man on God's throne. \n5.He will have the Arabic letters kaf, fa and ra (kafir) -meaning unbeliever- branded on his forehead. \n6.He will have the ability to revive the dead, and consequently claim to be God. \n7.Some traditions of Islam relate that he will appear at Isfahan, and that he will rally the Isfahan Jews and many women to his support.\nThe Prophet Muhammad asked his followers to recite the first and last ten verses of Chapter 'The Cave' as protection from the Dajjal. These verses deal with the beliefs and activities of the Christian nations. He also taught his followers to pray, ""O Allah! I seek refuge in Thee from the trial of the Dajjal."" He also said, There is no tribulation greater than that of the Dajjal from the creation of Adam to the day of resurrection.\nThe occurrence of the Dajjal will correspond with the appearance of the Imam Mahdi, who will rally the faithful on earth to oppose him. Eventually, Isa (the name of Jesus in Arabic) will return from Heaven and slay the Dajjal. According to many interpretations this will occur near The Gate of Ludd (ancient city of Lydda) [1]. This will be followed by a Golden Age for Islam (not to be confused with the separate Islamic Golden Age) in which there are only true believers and almost everyone converts to Islam. Eventually decline will set in and by the will of Allah the End will come for Man. This is similar to a retelling of the Christian apocalypse where the end comes with the return of Jesus and Judgment Day.\nHe is mentioned in Chapter 16 of ""The Arabian Nights"": ""Sinbad Voyage 1"" or ""First Voyage""\n\n""Also to while away the time of waiting I explored a little island named Cassel, which belonged to King Mihrage, and which was supposed to be inhabited by a spirit named Deggial. Indeed, the sailors assured me that often at night the playing of timbals could be heard upon it."""
